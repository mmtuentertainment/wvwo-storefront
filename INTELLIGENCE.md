## The Real Story (Kim's Words - Dec 3, 2024)

> "We started out as a sporting goods store for all sports in Fayetteville-Fayette County (New River Gorge area). We moved to Hico (still in Fayette Co). Couldn't make it at that location! Moved closer to home in I believe 2013 to Birch River."

> "Opened and went through the flood in 2016 and lost over $70,000 wholesale with FEMA not helping due to being commercial and shortly thereafter over a $10,000 theft loss with no insurance to cover."

> "But, Matthew - my GOD IS INDEED GOOD ALL THE TIME! We were awarded the federal contract and was able to rebuild and restore! Now, our overhead is a handful! That's God! We own the building and own every single thing in the building."

> "Matt, always keep your chin up! I have learned when things are rough, you still praise God Almighty! When a door closes, definitely look for the blessing because it indeed will come! God is so, so, so good!"

## What Perplexity Got Wrong

| Perplexity's Claim | Reality |
|--------------------|---------|
| "Garden hub" dual identity | Hunting store + spring potato sales (sideline only) |
| Onion sets, tomatoes, perennials | **None observed** - seed potatoes only |
| Complex "seasonal chameleon" model | Simple: hunting primary, potatoes secondary |
| Needed elaborate toggle architecture | Needs honest one-pager |
| Generic "community hub" framing | Specific survival story: flood, theft, federal contract |

---

## Digital Presence Status

| Platform | Status | Notes |
|----------|--------|-------|
| Facebook | Active (~700 followers) | Primary presence, sporadic posts |
| Google Business | **MISSING** | Critical gap |
| Yelp | Wrong address (506 Fire House Rd) | Needs claim + fix |
| Website | **NONE** | This project |
| Instagram | None | Future phase |

---

## Still Need to Gather

| Gap | Priority | Approach |
|-----|----------|----------|
| Bre's boyfriend name | Low | Next convo: guess wrong, she'll correct |
| What they're most proud of | Medium | "What part of the store makes you happiest?" |
| Pain points | Medium | "What do people always ask for that you don't have?" |
| Future vision | Medium | "Ever think about expanding?" |
| Contracts/grants they're chasing | Low | Follow up on her mention |

Key findings:
