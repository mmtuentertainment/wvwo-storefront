## Timeline (CONFIRMED & CORRECTED)

| Year | Event | Location |
|------|-------|----------|
| **2008** | Founded - "sporting goods store for all sports" | Fayetteville (New River Gorge) |
| ~2010 | Moved - "Couldn't make it at that location" | Hico (Fayette County) |
| **2013** | Moved to Birch River | **Stucco building** (now neighbor's property) |
| **June 23, 2016** | Flood - Lost $70,000 wholesale inventory | Stucco building flooded |
| 2016+ | Theft - Lost $10,000, no insurance | Same period |
| After 2016 | Relocated to corner lot | **Current location** (121 Birch River Rd) |
| **After recovery** | Landlord told them "Move out!" | Forced to find new building |
| **Now** | Lease current building, own all inventory | Small storefront (~shed-sized) |

### Physical Store Context
- **Size:** Small storefront (approximately lawn mower shed scale)
- **Ownership:** They LEASE the building, own all inventory outright
- **Previous location:** Stucco building next door (now neighbor's property)
- **The $70k flood loss:** Was likely their ENTIRE inventory at the time
- **"Country store" positioning:** Accurate and intentional - small is the point

### The Eviction Detail
After recovering from the flood and theft, the landlord told them to leave. As Kim put it:
> "I told Bryan then that (giggling) to shut up and get ready for a blessing."

This led them to find a new location - turning what felt like another disaster into a fresh start.

## The 2016 Flood (VERIFIED - Dec 3, 2024)

### What Happened
- **Date:** June 23, 2016 - Flash flooding, 8-10 inches of rain in 12 hours
- **June 25, 2016:** Presidential disaster declaration (FEMA-4273-DR)

### Birch River Impact
- Birch River at Herold reached **record crest**
- Old Route 19 "significantly damaged" - large sections collapsed
- Residents stranded, sheltered at Powell Mountain Church
- Multiple structures along Old Route 19 affected

### Why FEMA Denied Help
- **Braxton County was NOT declared** for Individual Assistance
- Only Greenbrier, Kanawha, Nicholas counties were eligible
- Commercial businesses excluded from FEMA grants regardless
- Only option: SBA disaster loans (debt, not grants)

### Kim's Account vs. Official Record
| Kim's Claim | Verified? |
|-------------|-----------|
| Flood in 2016 | ✅ June 23, 2016 |
| Birch River hit hard | ✅ Record crest, road collapsed |
| Lost $70k | ✅ Plausible - pattern documented |
| FEMA denied (commercial) | ✅ Braxton County excluded entirely |
| Had to relocate | ✅ Consistent with area businesses |

**Conclusion:** Kim's account is 100% consistent with official records.

## Competitive Landscape (30-Mile Radius)

### The "Corridor Void"
Birch River sits between two retail hubs with no dedicated outfitter in between:

| Hub | Distance | Drive Time | What's There |
|-----|----------|------------|--------------|
| **Summersville** (South) | 19 mi | 22 min | Walmart, Lowes, Tractor Supply |
| **Sutton/Flatwoods** (North) | 18 mi | 21 min | Walmart, Sutton Lake access |

### Direct Competitors

| Store | Location | Distance | Notes |
|-------|----------|----------|-------|
| Walmart Supercenter | Summersville | 19 mi | Price baseline, basic gear |
| Walmart Supercenter | Sutton | 18 mi | Similar to Summersville |
| T&T Outdoors | Mt. Nebo | 23 mi | FFL transfers $20, firearms focus |
| Smarrs Outdoor Services | Flatwoods | 20 mi | Archery, bait, FFL |
| Friendly Bass & Buck | Summersville | 19 mi | Fishing focus |

### The Value Proposition
> "A 45-minute round trip to Walmart for a box of .22 shells or a bottle of doe estrus is inconvenient."

**WV Wild Outdoors wins on:**
- Convenience (no 45-min round trip)
- Specialized inventory (calibers Walmart doesn't stock)
- Local knowledge
- FFL services
- Personal service ("they know your name")

## Demographics: Braxton County

| Stat | Value | Implication |
|------|-------|-------------|
| Population | ~12,146 | Small, tight-knit community |
| Median age | 46.7 years | Older, traditional hunters |
| Median income | $44,449 | Price sensitive |
| Veteran population | High | Military discounts = loyalty |

### Customer Profile
- Values durability and value over status
- Hunts the same 50 acres their grandfather did
- Drives a 10-year-old truck
- Suspicious of gear "too pretty to get bloody"
- Views store as "trading post" - place to swap stories

---

## WV Hunting Culture (Voice Research)

### The "Buck Season" Phenomenon
- Opening week of rifle season (Thanksgiving week) is a **civic event**
- Braxton County Schools closed entire week ("Buck Season Break")
- Family homecoming - people drive back from out of state
- The woods "turn orange" with hunters

### Terrain Terminology (Use These)
| Term | Meaning |
|------|---------|
| **Bench** | Flat strip on hillside (deer travel corridor) |
| **Holler** | Deep valley between ridges |
| **Knob** | Top of a hill |
| **Saddle** | Low point between peaks (ambush spot) |
| **Mast** | Acorn crop ("mast is heavy" = good hunting) |
| **Pole line** | Power line right-of-way (shooting lanes) |

### Trusted Gear (What They Actually Buy)

| Category | Trusted Brands | Notes |
|----------|---------------|-------|
| **Boots** | Muck, LaCrosse Alpha Burly | Rubber boots for mud/creek crossings |
| **Ammo** | Remington Core-Lokt, Hornady American Whitetail | "It just works" |
| **Calibers** | .270, .30-06, 30-30 | "The holy trinity" |
| **Camo** | Mossy Oak, Realtree | Mismatched is fine; matching = city hunter |
| **Rifles** | Savage Axis, Ruger American, vintage Marlins | Working man's standard |

### The "Meat Hunter" Ethos
- Primary goal: **"Filling the freezer"**
- A dry doe is a trophy (eats better than rutty buck)
- Deep hatred for waste - "If you kill it, you eat it"
- Focus on provision, not just sport

### Insider Phrases for Copy
| Use This | Not This |
|----------|----------|
| "Buck season" | "Deer hunting season" |
| "Filling the freezer" | "Bagging a trophy" |
| "The mast is heavy" | "Good acorn crop" |
| "We know why schools close this week" | "Open during hunting season" |

This captures her faith-forward resilience perfectly - every setback is reframed as God making room for something better.

### About Us Draft

> **We've been here since 2008.**
>
> Started in Fayetteville. Moved to Hico - couldn't make it. Moved to Birch River in 2013. Then June 23, 2016 happened.
>
> The flood hit Birch River hard. Record water levels. Old Route 19 collapsed. We lost $70,000 in inventory overnight. FEMA said no - Braxton County wasn't on their list. Then someone broke in and took another $10,000.
>
> After we rebuilt, the landlord told us to move out. We could have given up. Instead, we found a new place.
>
> Today we're still here. We own every single thing in this shop. No debt on inventory. Just us.
>
> When a door closes, look for the blessing. God is good.

## What Perplexity Got Wrong

| Perplexity's Claim | Reality |
|--------------------|---------|
| Address "506 Fire House Rd" | Wrong - that's old location, now 121 Birch River Rd |
| "Appears smaller operation" | It IS small, but full legitimate storefront |
| "Garage-based FFL?" | Wrong - full storefront (leased), own all inventory |
| "Garden hub" dual identity | Wrong - hunting store + spring potato sales only |
| Onion sets, tomatoes, perennials | None observed - seed potatoes only |
| Complex "seasonal chameleon" | Simple: hunting primary, potatoes secondary |
