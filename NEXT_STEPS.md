## Immediate Next Touchpoint

**When:** Thursday, December 5, 2024 (morning)

**Context:** Kim signed off mentioning church flyers and contracts/grants search

**Message to send:**
```
Hey, how'd the church flyers turn out? Any luck on those contracts?
```

**Goal:** Re-open conversation, show you remembered, lead into deeper topics

## Pending Intel: Bre's Boyfriend Name

**Strategy:** Guess wrong. She'll correct you.

**After she responds to the Thursday message, use:**
```
Good to hear. Hey, what's Bre's guy's name again - Jordan? If I ever need work done when I'm down there, I'd rather give money to family than some random contractor.
```

**Why this works:**
- Guessing wrong triggers correction instinct
- Reason for asking (hiring him) makes it natural
- "Family" framing builds goodwill

## Deeper Questions (Use After More Rapport)

### What They're Proud Of
```
With everything you've been through - the flood, the theft, building back up - what part of the store makes you happiest now? Like what's the thing you look at and think "yeah, we did that"?
```

### Pain Points
```
Random question - what do people always come in asking for that you don't have? Like is there something you wish you could stock but can't?
```

### Future Vision
```
You ever think about expanding or is keeping it small the goal? I know Bryan's got enough on his plate already lol
```

### Digital Frustrations (Leads to Website Gift)
```
Do people ever have trouble finding you? Like do they call asking for directions or say they couldn't find you on Google?
```

## Messages to AVOID

❌ "What would you want on a website?" (spoils surprise)

❌ "I'm working on something for you" (spoils surprise)

❌ "What's your exact inventory?" (too direct, weird)

❌ Rapid-fire questions in one message (feels like interrogation)

## Relationship Dynamics to Remember

**Kim's patterns:**
- Short response = busy or tired, don't push
- Wall of text = she's in sharing mode, let her go
- 👍 emoji = conversation closed, don't reply
- Ministry mode = she wants to encourage you, let her

**Your leverage:**
- Vulnerability about your struggles (anxiety, rental losses)
- Asking about kids/grandkids
- Dad (Mike) as connection point
- Recent in-person visit = fresh rapport

**Her hot buttons:**
- Kasandra/CPS situation (she'll vent)
- Bryan taking on too much (she'll vent)
- Faith/God's provision (she'll preach, warmly)
- Kids' accomplishments (she's proud)

## After Intel Complete - Gift Reveal Strategy

**Timing:** After Christmas? Or Christmas gift?

**Approach options:**

1. **The Reveal Visit**
   - Drive down, show them the site on your phone
   - "I built you something"
   - Walk them through it

2. **The Remote Reveal**
   - Send link via Messenger
   - "Hey, I made you something. Check this out: [link]"
   - Follow up call to walk through

3. **The Handoff Package**
   - Print credentials, instructions
   - "Here's your website, here's how to update it"
   - Include Google Business Profile access

**Recommended:** Option 1 if you can visit, Option 2 if not
