## Geographic Context (From Existing Page)

**From burnsville-lake.astro Line 167**:
> "Multiple parking areas and access points throughout the WMA. Main access via Bulltown Historical Area off I-79."

**What This Tells Us**:
- Bulltown is a MAJOR access point (not obscure side attraction)
- Located at/near main entrance to WMA
- Already established as navigation landmark
- Likely has parking for visitors

**Implications**:
- Every I-79 traveler going to Burnsville Lake PASSES the historical site
- Natural "while you're here" opportunity
- Already mentioned on our page - just needs expansion

## Competitive Differentiation Analysis

### Summersville Lake Page (Existing)

**Unique Angles Used**:
- Bridge Day (world's largest BASE jumping event)
- Rock climbing destination
- Canyon views
- **NO historical/cultural content**

### Sutton Lake Page (Existing)

**Unique Angles Used**:
- Elk River WMA access
- Family fishing focus
- Multiple campgrounds
- **NO historical/cultural content**

### Burnsville Lake Opportunity

**Untapped Unique Angle**:
- ✅ Civil War battlefield preservation
- ✅ Educational + recreational combo
- ✅ ONLY WV lake with historical site at entrance
- ✅ Appeals to broader audience (not just anglers)

**SEO Gap**:
- Competitors focus 100% on outdoor recreation
- Burnsville can own "history + outdoors" niche
- Targets: Families, history buffs, educational trips, multi-generational groups

## Content Integration Strategy

### Current Burnsville Lake Page Status

**Already Mentions Bulltown** (Line 167):
- Brief mention in "Getting There" section
- Positioned as access point, not destination

**Missing Opportunities**:
1. **No "what makes this lake different" section** (all 3 lakes need this)
2. **No historical/cultural content** (competitive gap vs. Summersville's Bridge Day)
3. **No "more than fishing" pitch** (limits audience)
4. **No family education angle** (history = reason for non-anglers to care)

### Proposed Additions (Pending Research)

**1. Quick Info Grid Addition**:

```astro
<div>
  <span class="block text-2xl font-bold text-brand-brown">1863</span>
  <span class="text-sm text-brand-brown/60">Civil War Site</span>
</div>
```

**2. New Section: "More Than Fishing"** (After "What to Hunt", Before "Getting There"):

```astro
<section class="py-12 md:py-16 bg-white">
  <div class="container mx-auto px-4">
    <div class="max-w-3xl mx-auto">
      <h2 class="font-display font-bold text-2xl md:text-3xl text-brand-brown mb-8">
        More Than Fishing
      </h2>

      <div class="bg-brand-cream p-6 rounded-sm border-l-4 border-sign-green">
        <h3 class="font-bold text-brand-brown mb-2">Civil War History On-Site</h3>
        <p class="text-brand-brown/75 mb-4">
          [PENDING RESEARCH: 2-3 sentences about Battle of Bulltown, what visitors can see]
        </p>
        <p class="text-sm text-brand-brown/60">
          Good spot to stretch your legs between fishing sessions, especially if
          you've got kids who need more than just sitting in a boat.
        </p>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
</section>
```

**3. Enhanced "Getting There" Section**:
Update line 167-168 from:

```astro
<p class="mt-6 text-sm text-brand-brown/60">
  Multiple parking areas and access points throughout the WMA. Main access via
  Bulltown Historical Area off I-79.
</p>
```

To (pending research):

```astro
<p class="mt-6 text-sm text-brand-brown/60">
  Multiple parking areas and access points throughout the WMA. Main access via
  Bulltown Historical Area off I-79 — a preserved Civil War battlefield with
  [STRUCTURE DETAILS]. [HOURS IF APPLICABLE].
</p>
```

## Questions for Kim/Bryan (Local Knowledge)

**Before finalizing content, ask**:
1. Have you been to Bulltown historical area? What's actually there?
2. Do your customers ever mention it?
3. Is it well-maintained or overgrown?
4. Any good photo opportunities there?
5. Do you send people there (or should you)?

**Why This Matters**:
- Kim's authenticity is core brand value
- Can't write about it if she hasn't seen it
- Local knowledge > generic historical facts
- Need real customer stories, not just dates

## Risk Assessment

**Potential Issues to Verify**:

| Risk | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|--------|------------|
| Site is poorly maintained/overgrown | HIGH - Can't recommend eyesore | Verify current condition before writing |
| Site is closed/inaccessible | HIGH - Content would be misleading | Check current operating status |
| Site is boring (just a sign, no structures) | MEDIUM - Not worth emphasizing | Get photos/descriptions first |
| Site is far from lake recreation | MEDIUM - Weakens "while you're here" pitch | Verify actual distance/travel time |
| Historical facts are disputed/unclear | LOW - Use careful language | Multiple source verification |

**Go/No-Go Decision**:
- **GO**: If site is accessible, maintained, has visible structures, <10 min from campgrounds
- **NO-GO**: If site is closed, overgrown, or just a historical marker sign

## Next Steps (Research Workflow)

**Phase 1: Verification** (DO THIS FIRST)
1. Visit USACE Burnsville Lake website - search for "Bulltown"

2. Write visitor info (hours, parking, what to see)
3. Write integration pitch ("while you're here")
4. Draft Kim's voice description
5. Identify SEO keywords
6. Create content blocks for page

**Phase 4: Implementation** (If content approved)
