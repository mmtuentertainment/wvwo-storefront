## KEY FINDINGS FOR WVWO CONTENT

### Primary Camping Option
**Briar Point Campground at Stonewall Resort State Park** is the ONLY campground directly at Stonewall Jackson Lake. This is a state park facility, not USACE-operated, despite the lake being a USACE project.

### USACE Management Note
Stonewall Jackson Lake is a USACE lake, but the camping is managed by WV State Parks. Unlike some USACE lakes (like Burnsville), there are no separate USACE campgrounds at Stonewall Jackson.

### WMA Consideration
Stonewall Jackson Lake WMA surrounds the lake for hunting. The state park campground serves both recreational campers and hunters during hunting seasons.

### Nearby Options
Three private campgrounds in the Weston area (6-15 miles) provide year-round overflow options, all more affordable than the state park.

### Regional USACE Option
Bulltown Campground at Burnsville Lake (30-35 miles south) is the nearest large USACE campground, offering 204 sites at lower prices ($28-46 vs $63-75).

### Best for Hunters (WVWO Audience)
1. **Peak hunting season (fall):** Briar Point if available (on-site access to WMA)
2. **Budget-conscious:** Broken Wheel or Leisure Time (year-round, $20-30/night)
3. **Large group/long stay:** Bulltown at Burnsville (204 sites, lower fees, Oct-Nov off-season rates)
