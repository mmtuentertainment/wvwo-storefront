## Questions & Answers

People ask questions on Google. Add these yourself so you control the answers:

### Q: Do you do FFL transfers?
**A:** Yep! We handle FFL transfers for $25. Usually takes about 15 minutes once you're here. Just give us a call when your firearm ships so we know to expect it.

### Q: What are your hours?
**A:** We're open Monday through Friday 9am-5pm, Saturday 9am-2pm. Closed Sundays. Give us a call if you're making a special trip — we'll make sure someone's here.

### Q: Do you sell hunting and fishing licenses?
**A:** Sure do! We're an official WV DNR agent. We print hunting and fishing licenses right here in the shop. Takes just a few minutes.

### Q: How do I find you from I-79?
**A:** Take Exit 57. We're right there — across from GoMart, visible from Rt 19. You'll see us as soon as you get off the exit!

### Q: Do you buy used guns?
**A:** Sometimes! Depends on what you've got. Best to bring it by or give us a call. We're always happy to take a look.

### Q: Do you have ammo in stock?
**A:** We try to keep the popular calibers stocked — 9mm, .223, .308, 12 gauge, and more. Stock changes, so call ahead if you need something specific.
