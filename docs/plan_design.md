# WV Wild Outdoors - Design Plan & Sketches

## Visual References from Store Photos

- **Walls**: Unfinished / Knotty Pine wood paneling. This is the primary background texture.
- **Displays**: Vertical gun cases against the walls. High density of products.
- **Eclectic Mix**: Rifles displayed near plant starts/seeds. This "General Store" mix is critical to the authentic vibe.
- **Atmosphere**: "Organized Clutter" - warm, stocked, working store. Not a sterile showroom.

## Visual Metaphor

**"Walking up to the store on a crisp fall morning"**

- **Colors**: Dark Chocolate Brown (Siding), Hunter Green (Sign), Unpainted Lumber (Porch).
- **Texture**: Wood grain (Knotty Pine), metal, natural paper.
- **Vibe**: Rural, working building, not a "gift shop".
- **The Soul**: The store *is* the soul. We are digitizing the feeling of that specific little building.
- **Faith & Values**: Subtle, warm, welcoming. The "Southern Baptist" influence is in the *hospitality* and *community care*, not just symbols.
- **Appalachian Lore**: We are in the **Center of West Virginia**. The mountains are old.
  - **Cryptids**: Subtle nods to Bigfoot and the Flatwoods Monster (local lore).
  - **History**: Native roots, ancient landscape. The design should feel *grounded* and *timeless*.
- **Core Themes**: Hunting, Fishing, and the Mysteries of the Woods.

## Brand Strategy: From "Store" to "Brand"

We are not inventing a brand; we are **elevating** the store into a brand.

- **Identity**: "WV Wild Outdoors" - The name speaks to the *Wild* and the *Ancient*.
- **Consistency**: Knotty Pine textures mixed with "Old World" typography.
- **Trust**: Established in 2008, but rooted in a landscape that is millions of years old.
- **Voice**: Warm neighborly advice mixed with a respect for the deep woods.
