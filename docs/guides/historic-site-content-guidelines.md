# Historic Site Content Guidelines - Phase 4 Migration

**Purpose:** Guide Kim + historian hybrid workflow for populating WV historic sites with authentic Appalachian narratives.

**Philosophy:** Tell stories of mountain people through C→B→D→A narrative arc - balanced truth, raw reality, defiant spirit, reverent honor.

---

## Section 1: C→B→D→A Narrative Arc Framework

### When to Use Each Arc Phase

**C (Balanced Truth) - Hero Section:**
- **Purpose:** Respectful museum introduction
- **Tone:** Dignified, factual, accessible to all ages
- **Colors:** Coal-gray as neutral timeline, heritage-burgundy as museum respect
- **Example:** "Carnifex Ferry Battlefield - Where Union forces halted Confederate advance into Kanawha Valley"

**B (Raw Reality) - Historical Context:**
- **Purpose:** Unflinching historical honesty
- **Tone:** Direct, unsanitized, no euphemisms for exploitation
- **Colors:** Burgundy becomes blood metaphor, coal-gray shows control structures
- **Example:** "1912 Paint Creek Strike - Company guards killed 16 miners. Union families held out 12 months on starvation rations."

**D (Defiant Spirit) - Structures & Tours:**
- **Purpose:** Celebrate Appalachian resilience
- **Tone:** Pride without romanticizing suffering
- **Colors:** Coal-gray transforms to STRENGTH ("built from barons' scraps, built to last")
- **Example:** "These earthworks, dug by hand - same grit that built union halls after company towns fell."

**A (Reverent Honor) - Education & Programs:**
- **Purpose:** Honor survival, inspire next generation
- **Tone:** Hopeful, forward-looking, heritage-proud
- **Colors:** Full heritage palette celebrating endurance
- **Example:** "Where fourth-generation guides teach their kids the stories barons tried to bury."

### Color Meaning Evolution

| Color | C (Museum) | B (Reality) | D (Defiance) | A (Honor) |
|-------|-----------|-------------|--------------|-----------|
| Coal-gray (#424242) | Neutral timeline | Oppression/control | Strength/endurance | Foundation |
| Heritage-burgundy | Museum respect | Blood of strikes | Fighting spirit | Survival pride |
| Heritage-green | Landscape | Isolated mountains | Self-sufficient | Rooted heritage |

## Section 2: Coal Baron Exploitation Language

### Approved Phrases (Use Freely)

**Economic Control:**
- "Company scrip - paper money only good at company stores"
- "Controlled wages, owned the houses, but not the souls"
- "Debt peonage - miners owed more than they earned"
- "Baldwin-Felts guards enforced company rule with billy clubs and rifles"

**Paint Creek Strike Narrative (1912-1913):**
- "September 1912: 7,500 miners walked out demanding union recognition"
- "Company guards killed 16 strikers, wounded dozens more"
- "Mother Jones, age 79, rallied families through 12-month siege"
- "Miners held tent colonies in freezing rain - company evictions left families homeless"

**Union Organizing Language:**
- "Miners risked blacklisting to organize United Mine Workers locals"
- "Union halls became community centers - the only spaces barons didn't control"
- "Collective bargaining won 8-hour days, safety inspections, fair pay"

### Phrases to AVOID

**Euphemisms:**
- ❌ "Company towns provided housing" → ✅ "Company owned homes, evicted striking families"
- ❌ "Labor disputes" → ✅ "Company guards shot striking miners"
- ❌ "Economic hardship" → ✅ "Deliberate wage theft through scrip and company stores"

**Romanticization:**
- ❌ "Simpler times" (ignores exploitation)
- ❌ "Hard but honest work" (ignores dangerous conditions, child labor)

---

## Section 3: "Don't Tread on Me" Defiance Integration

### Mother Jones Quotes (Use with Context)

**Approved for Structures/Tours (D arc):**
- "Pray for the dead, and fight like hell for the living."
- "I'm not a humanitarian, I'm a hell-raiser."
- "Sit down and read. Educate yourself for the coming conflicts."

**Context Required:**
- Always cite Mother Jones by name and role (union organizer, 1837-1930)
- Pair quotes with specific actions (organizing tent colonies, leading marches)

### Miner Resistance Stories

**Structural Defiance Narratives:**
- "Built these union halls from lumber scraps barons threw away - built to outlast the company towns."
- "When company evictions came, neighbors hid blacklisted miners in root cellars."
- "Strikers' children walked 6 miles to school rather than use company facilities."

**Balance Grit Without Glorifying Suffering:**
- ✅ "Families survived on cornmeal and solidarity"
- ❌ "Hardship built character" (romanticizes deprivation)

---

## Section 4: Contested Narratives Presentation

### Multi-Perspective Template

**Format for Disputed Events:**
```
Union sources report [specific claim with evidence].
Confederate/Company accounts describe [alternative view with evidence].
Modern historians [consensus interpretation if available].
```

**Carnifex Ferry Example:**
```
Union reports: "Confederate forces retreated after 7-hour artillery bombardment, abandoning fortified positions."
Confederate accounts: "General Floyd executed strategic withdrawal to preserve forces for Sewell Mountain defense."
Modern consensus: Union tactical victory (held field), Confederate strategic success (avoided encirclement).
```

### Multi-Perspective Without False Equivalence

**Appropriate Balance:**
- Civil War military tactics: Present both Union/Confederate perspectives
- Labor strikes: Present miner/company perspectives BUT acknowledge power imbalance
- Indigenous displacement: Center indigenous voices, company justifications as historical record

**Where NOT to Both-Sides:**
- Safety violations causing deaths (company negligence, not "different views")
- Wage theft via scrip (documented exploitation, not "business practices")

## Section 5: The Counter Test (Kim's Voice)

### Blacklisted Corporate Phrases

**NEVER USE (tech startup language):**
- "Unlock potential" | "Seamless experience" | "Revolutionize" | "Next-level"
- "Transform the way you" | "All-in-one platform" | "Cutting-edge solutions"
- "Curated experience" | "Elevated offerings" | "Premium selection"

### Corporate → Authentic Rewrites

| Corporate ❌ | Authentic ✅ |
|-------------|-------------|
| "Discover curated exhibits" | "See the artifacts miners used" |
| "Immersive historical experience" | "Walk where the battle happened" |
| "Premium guided tours" | "Rangers who grew up hearing these stories" |
| "Unlock WV heritage" | "Your grandparents' history, preserved" |

### Local Reference Integration

**Neighbor Language (Kim's Test):**
> "Would Kim's neighbors recognize this as their history?"

**Mountain Dialect (Use Sparingly):**
- "Over yonder" (directional), "Right smart walk" (distance)
- "Poke sallet" (food reference), "Haint blue" (paint color)
- Use in quotes from historical figures, not marketing copy

**Faith-Forward Language (When Appropriate):**
- Church social halls as organizing spaces
- "Faith that outlasted company rule"
- Respectful, not preachy

## Quick Reference Checklist

**Before Publishing Any Historic Site:**

- [ ] C→B→D→A arc flows naturally (Hero → Context → Structures → Education)
- [ ] Coal baron language uses approved phrases (no euphemisms)
- [ ] Defiance narratives balanced (grit without romanticizing suffering)
- [ ] Contested events show multiple perspectives appropriately
- [ ] Zero corporate buzzwords (passes Kim's neighbor test)
- [ ] All images have Library of Congress/Archives citations
- [ ] Heritage colors match narrative arc (coal-gray evolution documented)
- [ ] Tone shifts match sections (museum → raw → defiant → reverent)

**Kim's Final Question:**
> "Would a Paint Creek miner's great-granddaughter recognize her family's story here - unvarnished, unsanitized, and honored?"

If yes, publish. If no, rewrite with more backbone.
