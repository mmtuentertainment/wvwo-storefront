## Sutton Lake West Virginia History and Cultural Sites

### Dam Construction History

**Authorization and Construction Timeline:**

- Authorized by Congress in the Flood Control Act of 1938[^1][^2][^3]
- Construction began in October 1949[^3][^4]
- Work interrupted by the Korean War in 1952[^1][^3]
- Construction resumed in 1956 with formal groundbreaking[^4][^1]
- Completed in 1961 at a cost of \$35 million[^2][^5][^4][^1]
- Dedicated by Governor Barron on July 8, 1961[^1]

**Dam Specifications:**

- 210 feet high, 1,178 feet long, 195 feet wide at base[^5][^2][^1]
- Constructed entirely of concrete (differs from nearby Burnsville Dam)[^1]
- Controls 537 square mile drainage area[^2][^1]
- Created 1,520-acre lake at summer pool[^1]
- Has prevented more than \$375-\$400 million in flood damages[^6][^5]


### Communities Flooded by Dam Construction

**General Acknowledgment:**
Families were displaced from homesteads to construct Sutton Lake and Dam, though the documentation provides only general references rather than specific details.[^7]

**Land Acquisition:**
The U.S. Army Corps of Engineers Huntington District conducted land acquisition for the project. According to historical documentation, "The land acquisition process was not easy" at USACE projects during this era.[^8]

**Documented Impact:**
One descendant recalled: "families displaced from homesteads to construct Sutton Lake and Dam" as part of the complicated legacy of the Elk River valley. A Facebook post references someone gathering "stories from descendants of workers on the dam, government officials involved, and families who'd been displaced by the dam", though the specific publication is not identified.[^9][^7]

### Historic Significance of Elk River Valley

**Early Settlement (1780s-1800s):**

**Carpenter Family - First European Settlers:**
The first permanent European-American settlers in Braxton County are believed to have been members of the Carpenter family, who settled at the mouth of Holly River in the 1780s.[^10][^11][^12]

Brothers Benjamin and Jeremiah Carpenter, along with their mother, arrived in the late 1700s (circa 1790 or earlier). With belongings including a fiddle tied to the backs of oxen, they followed creeks and Indian paths through the wilderness until they reached the mouth of Laurel Fork (later called Centralia), near the present Braxton-Webster county line. Legend holds that the Elk River was named for an elk killed by Jeremiah Carpenter.[^13][^11][^12][^14]

The Carpenter family became substantial landholders in the Elk Valley and on nearby Holly River. According to family descendant Ernie Carpenter: "My great-great-grandfather and his family once owned just about all of Holly River. He traded it off for a horse and saddle, a mountain rifle and bear dog."[^11]

**Town of Sutton Settlement:**

- 1792: Adam O'Brien settled at O'Brien's Fork of Salt Lick Creek[^15][^16][^17][^18]
- 1809: John D. Sutton settled at the confluence of Granny's Creek and Elk River at the edge of present-day Sutton[^19][^16][^17][^15][^1]
- 1826: Town established as "Suttonsville" (also known as "Suttonville" and "Newville")[^16][^15]
- 1835: Town formally laid out[^17][^15][^16]
- 1836: Braxton County formed; first court held in home of John D. Sutton[^15][^10][^16]

**Strategic Location:**
Sutton was situated at the confluence of major transportation routes:[^16][^17][^15]

- Elk River was navigable to Charleston at times[^15][^16]
- Weston \& Gauley Bridge Turnpike (chartered 1848, completed 1858) connected the Staunton \& Parkersburg Turnpike to the James River \& Kanawha Turnpike via Sutton[^20][^21][^22][^16]
- 1853: Suspension bridge constructed across Elk River at Sutton on the turnpike; cable suspension bridge spanned 460 feet[^23][^17][^20][^16]


### Civil War History

**Military Significance:**
Due to its strategic location on the Weston \& Gauley Bridge Turnpike and Elk River, Sutton was heavily involved in the Civil War.[^17][^16][^15]

**September 5, 1861:** Town occupied by 5,000 Union troops[^19][^16][^17][^15]

**Later 1861:** General William Rosecrans bivouacked 10,000 Union troops in Sutton, including future President William McKinley[^19][^16][^17][^15]

**December 29, 1861 - Burning of Sutton:**
Confederate soldiers burned most of downtown Sutton, leaving only six structures intact. The courthouse and most buildings were destroyed in the inferno.[^24][^10][^16][^17][^19][^15]

Around 10 a.m. on December 29, approximately 80 Confederate soldiers attacked a small Union fort guarding the town, which was garrisoned by about 100 Union cavalry. The Union soldiers fought back for six hours before retreating in defeat. Soon after the battle, the entire town was ablaze; nobody is certain who lit the first spark.[^24]

**December 31, 1861:** Union forces under General George Crook retook control of the town[^15]

Sutton slowly rebuilt from Civil War destruction but remained small until the timber industry boomed in the late 1800s.[^16][^17][^15]

**Post-Civil War Development:**

- 1883: Sutton incorporated[^15]
- 1890-1920: Commercial center during timber boom; many historic buildings in Sutton Downtown Historic District date from this period[^17][^16][^15]
- 1987: Sutton Downtown Historic District added to National Register of Historic Places[^16]


### Weston \& Gauley Bridge Turnpike

**Historic Turnpike Near Sutton Lake:**
The Weston and Gauley Bridge Turnpike is a 10-mile preserved segment of historic turnpike located at Burnsville Lake (adjacent to Sutton Lake area), approximately 20 feet wide with unpaved surface.[^21][^20]

**Significance:**

- Built starting in 1847 to provide access to Sutton for transport to grist mills, sawmills, Bulltown salt works, and farmland[^20][^21]
- During the Civil War, used by Union troops in 1861 to move and take control of western Virginia[^21][^20]
- Critical in troop movement during Battle of Bulltown, October 13, 1863[^20][^21]
- One of the first turnpikes in Virginia to run north-south[^20]
- Listed on National Register of Historic Places in 1995[^20]

**Three Major Bridges:**

- One over the Elk at Sutton (460-foot suspension bridge)
- One over the Little Kanawha near Bulltown
- One over the West Fork near Weston[^23]

**Nearby Bulltown Historic Area (Burnsville Lake, ~15 miles from Sutton Lake):**

The Bulltown Historic Area is administered by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers as part of the Burnsville Lake project.[^25][^26][^27][^21]
