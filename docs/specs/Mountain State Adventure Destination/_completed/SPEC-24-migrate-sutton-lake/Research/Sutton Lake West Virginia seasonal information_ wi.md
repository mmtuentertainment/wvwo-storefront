# Sutton Lake West Virginia seasonal information: winter pool drawdown dates and feet, summer pool dates, which facilities close seasonally (and when), ice fishing conditions if applicable, spring flooding patterns, fall foliage peak timing. USACE operational data preferred.

Now I have comprehensive information to provide a complete answer about Sutton Lake's seasonal operations.

## Sutton Lake West Virginia Seasonal Information

### Pool Elevation Schedule

**Summer Pool:**

- **Elevation:** 922 feet above mean sea level[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5]
- **Dates:** April 15 - November 30[^4]
- **Summer Controls:** In effect during this period[^4]

**Winter Pool:**

- **Elevation:** 895 feet above mean sea level[^2][^5]
- **Dates:** December 1 - April 14[^4]
- **Winter Controls:** In effect during this period[^4]
- **Drawdown Amount:** 27 feet below summer pool[^2]

**Purpose of Winter Drawdown:**
The lake is lowered each winter to provide additional flood storage capacity for winter snowmelt and spring rains. This controlled drawdown also allows USACE staff to access near-shore areas for shoreline maintenance and dam inspection activities.[^6][^2]

**Special Drawdown Events:**
In 2019, Sutton Lake was drawn down an additional 30 feet below winter pool (to approximately 865 feet) during December for dam maintenance work. "Presently the lake has been lowered five feet below winter pool and by the first of December should be 30 feet below winter pool," stated a November 2019 announcement.[^2]

### Seasonal Facility Closures

#### **Campgrounds:**

**Gerald R. Freeman Campground:**

- **Open:** April 18 - November 29[^7][^3][^8][^1]
- **Closed:** December 1 - April 17 (off-season)[^7]
- **Peak Season:** April through November[^7]
- **Reservation System:** Available through Recreation.gov year-round for upcoming season[^8]

**Bakers Run Campground:**

- **Open:** May 1 - September 30[^9][^10][^11]
- **Closed:** October 1 - April 30[^10]
- **Note:** Closes before peak fall foliage[^10]

**Bee Run Campground (Primitive):**

- **Open:** Late May - Early December (after deer season)[^12][^13][^9]
- **Closed:** Mid-December through mid-May[^9]
- **Note:** Timing depends on West Virginia deer hunting season closure[^9]

**West Virginia Deer Season Timing (for reference):**

- Buck firearms season: November 24 - December 7[^14]
- Muzzleloader season: December 14-21[^14]
- Archery/crossbow season: September 27 - December 31[^14]


#### **Marinas and Boat Launches:**

**Sutton Lake Marina (Private):**

- **Open:** Mid-April to mid-October each year[^15][^16]
- **Hours:** 9:00 AM - 6:00 PM Monday-Saturday; Closed Sunday[^17]
- **Last Day of Boat Rentals 2025:** October 10, 2025[^18]
- **Note:** Subject to water levels; early closures possible if lake level drops significantly[^19]

**USACE Boat Ramps:**

- **Operational Issues Related to Winter Pool:**
    - Bee Run boat ramp closes when lake level drops below 917 feet[^4]
    - Bakers Run boat ramp closes when lake level drops below 910 feet (ramp toe exposed)[^4]
    - Gerald Freeman boat ramp closes when lake level drops below 912 feet (ramp toe exposed)[^4]
- During winter drawdown to 895 feet, most or all boat ramps become unusable

**Picnic Shelters:**

- **Closed:** Winter season[^20]
- **Open:** Spring through fall (specific dates not documented)[^20]
- **Reservations:** Available through Recreation.gov when facilities reopen[^21][^9]


### Ice Fishing Conditions

**Ice fishing at Sutton Lake is NOT documented as a regular activity in official USACE or WV DNR sources.**

West Virginia's climate generally does not produce consistent, safe ice conditions on large reservoirs. One Facebook comment mentions hypothetically: "I know when the lake freezes over, people ride their snow machines and go ice fishing out there", but this appears speculative rather than based on actual conditions.[^22]

**Why Sutton Lake Rarely Freezes:**

- Average winter temperatures in Sutton range from lows of 22°F-27°F (December-February) to highs of 42°F-47°F[^23]
- Large reservoirs like Sutton Lake (1,440 acres) typically do not freeze solid in West Virginia's relatively mild winters
- Winter drawdown to 895 feet further reduces water surface area and stability
- No official guidance or safety information for ice fishing at Sutton Lake exists

**Alternative Winter Fishing:**
Trout fishing in the Sutton Dam tailwaters (Elk River below dam) is excellent during winter months, with regular stocking occurring in January, February, and fall.[^24][^25][^26]

### Spring Flooding Patterns

**Flood Control Purpose:**
Sutton Lake is authorized primarily for flood risk management. The dam and reservoir have prevented over \$375-400 million in flood damages since completion in 1961.[^27][^28][^29][^30][^31][^32][^6]

**Spring Flood Management:**

- Winter pool drawdown (December 1 - April 14) provides maximum flood storage capacity during spring snowmelt and rain season[^2][^4]
- The 27-foot drawdown creates approximately 27,000-30,000 acre-feet of additional flood storage capacity
- Lake begins refilling to summer pool around mid-April as flood risk decreases[^4]
- By April 14-15, lake typically at or near summer pool elevation (922 feet)[^3][^1]

**Drainage Basin:**
Sutton Dam controls a 537-542 square mile drainage area of the Elk River watershed[^33][^28][^34]

**Spring Water Levels:**
Early April 2025 lake reports show elevation at 922.70-922.77 feet (at summer pool) with outflows of 1,264-1,816 cubic feet per second (CFS) and water temperatures of 50-52°F.[^1][^3]

**Impact on Recreation:**

- Spring high water and cold temperatures limit early-season recreation
- Campgrounds open mid-April to late May depending on conditions[^10][^7][^9]
- Boat ramps fully accessible once summer pool is reached[^4]


### Fall Foliage Peak Timing

**Peak Foliage in Sutton Lake Area (Braxton County):**
**Early to mid-October**[^35][^36]

**West Virginia Fall Color Progression:**[^37][^35]

- Late September to early October: High-elevation Allegheny Mountains
- **Early to mid-October:** Mid-elevation valleys and ridges (includes Sutton Lake)
- Mid to late October: Low-elevation regions and river valleys
- Late October to early November: Southern counties

**Best Foliage Viewing Near Sutton Lake:**

- **Holly River State Park** (12-15 miles away): Early October peak[^38][^39]
- **Sutton Lake shoreline trails:** Early October[^40][^35]
- **Elk River Wildlife Management Area:** Early October[^41][^42]

**Fall Recreation Season:**

- Sutton Lake remains at summer pool (922 feet) through November 30[^4]
- Gerald R. Freeman Campground open through November 29[^8][^7]
- Bakers Run Campground closes September 30, missing peak foliage season[^10]
- Sutton Lake Marina closes mid-October[^16][^15]
- Fall fishing excellent for bass, walleye, and trout (tailwaters)[^43][^44]

**Optimal Conditions for Fall Color:**
Warm days followed by crisp nights trigger chlorophyll breakdown, revealing brilliant yellows, oranges, and reds. West Virginia's diverse hardwood forests—including maples, oaks, hickories, and birches—create spectacular autumn displays throughout the Elk River valley.[^35]

### Temperature and Weather Patterns

**Summer (June-August):**[^23]

- Average high: 82-85°F
- Average low: 60-63°F
- Best time for warm-weather water recreation

**Fall (September-November):**[^23]

- Average high: 72°F (Sept) to 53°F (Nov)
- Average low: 54°F (Sept) to 36°F (Nov)
- Peak camping and hiking season with fall colors

**Winter (December-February):**[^23]

- Average high: 42-47°F
- Average low: 22-27°F
- Lake drawn down to winter pool; most facilities closed

**Spring (March-May):**[^23]

- Average high: 55°F (March) to 76°F (May)
- Average low: 34°F (March) to 53°F (May)
- Wildflower season mid-April to early May[^45][^37]
- Facilities begin reopening late April/early May
