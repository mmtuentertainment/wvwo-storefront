## Sutton Lake Wildlife Viewing and Nature

### Elk River Wildlife Management Area

**Location:** Adjacent to Sutton Lake in Braxton and Webster Counties, West Virginia[^1][^2]

**Size:** 18,225-18,396 acres total[^3][^2][^1]

- 10,235 acres leased from U.S. Army Corps of Engineers
- 6,949 acres state-owned
- Combined: nearly 18,000 acres of public hunting and wildlife lands[^4]

**Terrain:** The WMA is divided into two sections:[^4][^3]

- **Elk River Section:** Primarily steep hills, ridges, and benches with mature hardwood forests, including some old-growth timber
- **Holly River Section:** Located on the north side of the lake; consists of forested hills and open farmlands

***

### Wildlife Species Present

#### **Big Game**[^2][^5][^3][^4]

- White-tailed deer
- Wild turkey


#### **Small Game and Waterfowl**[^3][^2][^4]

- Squirrel
- Ruffed grouse
- Waterfowl (Canadian geese and other species)
- Mourning dove

**Wildlife Observations:** Visitors to Bakers Run Campground and surrounding WMA areas commonly hear turkeys gobbling and see white-tailed deer along with other wildlife. The Elk River has the highest species diversity and richness of any river in the entire state of West Virginia.[^5]

***

### Bird Species

**No official bird species checklist for Sutton Lake is published by USACE or WV DNR sources.**

General waterfowl observations include Canadian geese and other waterfowl species present on the lake. Sutton Lake is not specifically listed among WV DNR's designated bird watching areas, though the region supports woodland birds, waterfowl, and field species typical of central West Virginia.[^7][^4]

***

### Native Pollinator Garden at Sutton Dam

**Location:** Right side of the road just past Sutton Dam heading toward South Abutment; also serves as the trailhead for five hiking trails (Sunrise Ridge, Ellison Cemetery, Bug Ridge, Sunshine Line, and Hardwood Timber Loop)[^8][^9]

**Established:** 2020 season[^9][^8]

**Partnership:** Collaborative project between USACE Sutton Lake and Judy's Garden Club (Appalachian District)[^8][^9]

**Design and Features:**[^9][^8]

- Egg-shaped garden design
- Natural flat stone walkways constructed from relocated native stone
- Rock border
- Interpretive pollinator sign explaining the importance of native plants for wildlife habitat, insect food sources, and songbird survival
- Over 220 volunteer hours invested in locating, digging, and replanting native species
- Approximately 100 West Virginia native plants donated by garden club members

**Soil Amendments:** Lime, compost, and mulch added based on soil testing recommendations from West Virginia University's Department of Agriculture Extension Office[^8]

**Funding:** Received \$1,000 National Garden Clubs Plant America Grant used for plant identification tags, bench, and butterfly house[^8]

**Purpose:**[^9][^8]

- Increase pollinator populations at Sutton Lake using only West Virginia native plant species
- Provide educational opportunities for visiting public
- Teach current and future generations about the vital role of native plants in supporting pollinators, insects, birds, and other wildlife

**Specific plant species list:** Not found in official sources

### Fall Foliage Timing

**Sutton Lake Area (Braxton County):** Peak fall foliage occurs in **early to mid-October**[^10][^11]

**West Virginia Fall Foliage Progression:**[^12][^10]

- **Late September to early October:** High-elevation areas in the Allegheny Mountains
- **Early to mid-October:** Mid-elevation valleys and ridges (includes Sutton Lake region)
- **Mid to late October:** Low-elevation regions and river valleys
- **Late October to early November:** Southern counties and lower hills

**Optimal Viewing Conditions:** West Virginia's fall colors are most vibrant when warm days are followed by crisp nights, which trigger the breakdown of chlorophyll in leaves and reveal underlying pigments of yellow, orange, and red.[^10]

**Nearby Fall Foliage Destinations:**[^13][^14]

- **Holly River State Park** (12-15 miles from Sutton): Peak foliage typically in early October
- **Kumbrabow State Forest:** Peak foliage in early to mid-October

***

### Wildflower Season

**West Virginia Spring Wildflower Timing:**[^15][^16][^12]

- **Late February to early April:** First wildflowers appear in southern West Virginia along stream banks; blooming gradually progresses northward
- **Late March to mid-May:** Main wildflower season across the state
- **Mid-April to early May:** Peak wildflower viewing in central West Virginia (Sutton Lake region)

**Native Wildflower Species Recommended for West Virginia Pollinator Gardens:**[^17]

- **Butterflyweed Milkweed** (*Asclepias tuberosa*): Thrives statewide; serves as host plant for monarch butterfly caterpillars
- **Beardtongues** (*Penstemon laevigatus* or *P. digitalis*): Provides early-season nectar for bees
- **Asters** (*Symphyotrichum laeve*): Blooms late into fall, helping pollinators prepare for winter

**Specific wildflower species at Sutton Lake:** Not documented in official sources

***

### Nature Programs

**USACE Nature Programs at Sutton Lake:** Not found in official USACE sources

**WV DNR Regional Educational Programs:**

- Educational classes periodically held at Elk River Wildlife Management Area[^18]
- **West Virginia State Wildlife Center** (French Creek, nearby): A modern zoological facility displaying native and introduced state wildlife, including elk, black bears, mountain lions, and other animals[^19][^14]

**Self-Guided Opportunities:**

- Pollinator garden with interpretive signage at Sutton Dam[^9][^8]
- Hunting trails available year-round for hiking and wildlife viewing when not in hunting season[^20]
- Over 30 miles of trails on Elk River WMA maintained by WV DNR[^21][^4]

***

### Wildlife Observation Areas

**No designated wildlife observation areas, viewing blinds, or platforms are documented at Sutton Lake in official USACE or WV DNR sources.**

Wildlife viewing opportunities exist throughout the 18,000+ acres of Elk River Wildlife Management Area, particularly in campground areas and along trails. The diverse terrain—steep hills, ridges, benches, forested hills, and open farmlands—provides habitat for a variety of wildlife species.[^5][^20][^4][^3]

***

### Conservation and Research

**Wildlife Studies Conducted at USACE Lakes (including Sutton):**[^6]

- Wild turkey population dynamics studies (turkeys trapped and fitted with radio transmitters)
- Gobbler survivability research
- Wild Turkey Restoration Program (turkeys from Bluestone Lake WMA relocated to southern WV counties)

**Conservation Priorities:**[^6]

- Over 80 species of "Greatest Conservation Need" identified on USACE properties in West Virginia
- Rare species with only 100 occurrences known statewide have been documented on USACE lands
- Habitat management for river bottom wildlife species including cottontail rabbit, bobwhite quail, red-winged blackbirds, bobolinks, and whip-poor-wills

**Project Purpose:** Sutton Lake's authorized purposes include flood risk management, **fish and wildlife conservation**, recreation, low flow augmentation, and water quality control.[^22]
