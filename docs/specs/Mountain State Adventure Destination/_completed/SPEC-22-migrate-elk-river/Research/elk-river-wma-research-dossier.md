# Elk River Wildlife Management Area (WMA) — Comprehensive Public Guide

## Executive Summary

**Elk River Wildlife Management Area** is West Virginia's oldest and most accessible wildlife management area, encompassing 18,396–19,646 acres across Braxton County along the Elk River and Holly River, upstream of Sutton Lake. Managed by the **West Virginia Division of Natural Resources (WVDNR) Wildlife Resources Section**, this landscape of mature hardwood forest, river bottomlands, and ridge systems offers year-round outdoor recreation for all skill levels and interests. Unlike many WMAs narrowly focused on hunting and fishing, Elk River welcomes hikers, photographers, wildlife viewers, boaters, winter sports enthusiasts, and casual nature explorers. The area provides direct access to two productive rivers, a 1,440-acre warm-water lake with five public boat ramps, over 30 miles of established trails, and support for critical endangered aquatic species including the crystal darter and diamond darter fish.

## A) Overview: What It Is and Why Visit

**Elk River WMA** represents a precious public conservation legacy in central Appalachia. Established through WVDNR stewardship, the area protects ecologically significant hardwood forest and aquatic habitat while guaranteeing free or low-cost public access to outdoor recreation across nearly 19,000 acres. The WMA sits within a larger conservation context: the Elk River is one of West Virginia's most biologically diverse waterways, supporting over 100 fish species and 30 mussel species, including federally endangered freshwater mussels and darters found nowhere else on Earth. Visitors encounter mature oak-hickory and mixed mesophytic forests interspersed with younger growth, river bottomlands teeming with wildlife, and scenic ridge vistas. 

Why visit? The area is exceptionally *accessible*—road and trail networks crisscross the WMA, allowing easy pull-off entry without long backcountry approaches. It is *diverse*—simultaneously a hunter's stronghold and a birder's paradise, a serious angler's destination and a family day-hike spot. It is *uncrowded* compared to similar public lands, with vastly more elbow room than many state parks. And it offers *seasonal richness*: spring wildflowers and songbird migration, summer lake recreation, autumn foliage and hunter activity, winter quiet and occasional snow sports. Whether you seek solitude in old-growth forest, trophy fish, wild turkey bugling at dawn, or simply an afternoon riverside stroll, Elk River delivers.

- **Mitigation:** Tuck pants into socks, use DEET 20%+ insect repellent on skin and clothing, check entire body after hiking, remove embedded ticks promptly with tweezers (don't crush; pull straight out).

**Flooding (SEASONAL HAZARD):**
- Elk and Holly rivers subject to flash flooding during heavy rain.
- Sutton Lake level managed for flood control; sudden water release possible from dam.
- **Action:** Never camp in river bottoms. Avoid streams during or immediately after heavy rain. Monitor weather before hiking near riparian areas.

**Terrain (ONGOING HAZARD):**
- Steep hills, ridges, bench systems increase fall and slip risk.
- Root and rock obstacles on trails.
- **Mitigation:** Wear sturdy hiking boots. Watch footing on wet, icy, or leaf-covered terrain. No technical climbing skills required for WMA trails, but caution essential.

**River Hazards (WATER ACTIVITIES):**
- Cold water year-round (Elk River ~50–60°F even in summer).
- Fast current in sections below dam.
- Strong swimmers only; never wade alone.
- Water levels vary—check Sutton Lake conditions ((304) 765-2705) before float trips.
- **Action:** Wear PFD always when boating. Never enter water in cold months without expert safety planning.

**Weather (SEASONAL):**
- Appalachian weather highly changeable. Temperature swings 30°F+ common spring/fall.
- Sudden storms possible.
- Winter ice hazard on lake and streams.
- **Action:** Carry water, sun protection, rain jacket. Dress in layers. Check forecast before extended trips.

**Wildlife (COEXISTENCE HAZARD):**

- Store food securely at camps.
- Venomous snakes (copperhead, timber rattlesnake) rare but present in warm months. Avoid tall grass at dusk; watch footing in rocky areas.
- Defensive animals (raccoons, opossums) present. Never corner; allow escape.
- **Action:** Make noise while hiking to avoid surprise encounters. Back away slowly if bear spotted. Carry bear bell or talk periodically on trails.

### Emergency Contacts & Self-Rescue Guidance

**Emergency Services:** Call 911 from cell phone if coverage available (spotty on ridges).

**Nearest Hospital:** Braxton County Medical Center, Sutton, WV; ~20–30 min from remote WMA areas.

**EMS Response:** Inform dispatcher of WMA location; EMS may require hiking time to reach backcountry. Rescue operations may take 1–2 hours from remote trail access points.

**Communication:**
- Carry charged cell phone (acknowledge coverage limitations).
- Satellite communicator (e.g., Garmin InReach) recommended for backcountry trips.
- No cell service on most trails; dead zones common on ridges.

**Self-Rescue Protocol:**
1. Tell someone your planned route, expected return time, and contact plan.
2. If lost/injured, stay put on or near trail; rescuers search along planned routes.
3. Carry map, compass, basic first aid (blister kit, pain relief, bandages), water, food, headlamp.
4. Use whistle (3 blasts = distress signal) to signal rescuers.
5. Do not wander from trail expecting to "find way out"—most rescues succeed because subject stayed in place.

## F) Ecology & Conservation

### Habitat Types

1. **Mature Hardwood Forest:** Oak-hickory and mixed mesophytic forest dominating higher slopes and ridges. Old-growth timber interspersed with younger regeneration.

2. **Mixed & Young Forest:** Brush, regenerating timber, small openings created by timber management or natural disturbance. Critical for early-successional wildlife (turkey brood, grouse).

3. **River Bottomlands:** Elk River and Holly River floodplain with riparian vegetation, alluvial soils, diverse aquatic habitat.

4. **Ridge & Bench Systems:** Steep, forested slopes with benches (flat areas on slopes); complex topography provides wildlife corridor connectivity.

5. **Emergent Wetlands:** Small wetland areas in stream valleys; important for amphibians and waterfowl.

### Key Species & Notable Ecology

**Mammals:**
- **White-tailed Deer:** Abundant; primary game species; populations managed through regulated hunting.

**ENDANGERED & PROTECTED SPECIES:**

The Elk River contains federally endangered aquatic species found nowhere else or in very limited locations—representing globally rare conservation concern.

- **Crystal Darter (*Crystallaria asprella*):** 
  - **Status:** Federally endangered; endemic to Elk River (West Virginia population genetically distinct).
  - **Rarity:** Extremely rare; only 8 specimens documented as of mid-2000s from extensive surveys.
  - **Biology:** Benthic specialist; sand-burrowing darter preferring fast riffles and large rocks. Larvae drift in current; adults inhabit sandy/gravelly substrate.
  - **Threats:** Siltation (mining, logging, erosion), water quality degradation, stream flow modification from dam operations.
  - **Conservation Status:** Population approaching extinction according to biological status reviews.

- **Diamond Darter (*Etheostoma mooneyi*):**
  - **Status:** Federally endangered; found only in Elk River.
  - **Critical Habitat:** King Shoals to Coonskin Park (lower Elk River).
  - **Biology:** Benthic habitat specialist; requires clean, flowing water and complex substrate diversity.
  - **Threats:** Coal mining, oil/gas drilling, timber harvesting, ATV use, improper sewage treatment, stream bank erosion, sedimentation.

- **Spotted Darter (*Etheostoma maculatum*):**
  - **Status:** Rare in Elk River; listed in some states.
  - **Habitat Use:** Large rocks within glide habitat; rarely found in riffles (unlike historical records from other systems).
  - **Distribution in Elk River:** Documented at 9 sites during surveys; benthic habitat specialist subject to stream sedimentation impacts.

- **Freshwater Mussels (Lower Elk River below Sutton Dam):**
  - **Endangered/Threatened Species:** Clubshell (*Pleurobema clava*), pink mucket pearlymussel (*Lampsilis abrupta*), northern riffleshell (*Epioblasma torulosa rangiana*), rayed bean, snuffbox.
  - **Habitat:** Requires clean gravel/sand substrate, stable water flow, diverse benthic community.
  - **Threats:** Siltation, water quality, dam impacts on mussel movement.

**Broader Ecosystem Context:**
- Elk River is one of West Virginia's most ecologically diverse rivers overall, supporting 100+ fish species and 30 mussel species.
- Represents rare biodiversity hotspot for Appalachian freshwater ecosystems.
- Upper limestone-influenced sections (Pocahontas County headwaters) provide year-round cold-water habitat critical for trout species.
- Lower sandy/shale sections support diverse warm-water and specialized darter/mussel communities.

### Seasonal Ecology & Patterns

**Spring (April–May):**
- Wildflower blooms (ephemeral carpets, rhododendron thickets).
- Songbird migration peak (30+ warbler species, vireos, flycatchers transit northward).
- Turkey mating season; males vocalize (gobble) at dawn/dusk—best time for listening/observation.
- Beaver activity high; dam construction/maintenance.
- Fish spawning (bass, sunfish move to shallows).
- Tick emergence (peak begins late April–May).

**Summer (June–August):**
- Breeding season for all wildlife; reduced vocalization/visibility.
- Warm water; lake recreation peak.
- Insect abundance (mosquitoes peak late June–August).
- Tick population stabilizes at high levels.
- Early-successional habitat provides turkey poult (chick) nursery.
- Grouse broods fledging.

**Fall (September–November):**
- Acorn production; wildlife food abundance peaks. Deer and bear feeding intensely.
- Leaf color change (peak mid-October).
- Hawk migration (raptors concentrate on ridge thermals Sept–Oct).
- Deer rut (Sept–Oct); males (bucks) territorial, vocalize, increase activity.
- Hunting seasons open (Sept onward); hunter presence increases.
- Tick populations remain high through October.

**Winter (December–March):**
- Reduced insect activity; ticks dormant.
- Resident birds remain (eagles, ravens, woodpeckers, finches).
- Bear denning (Oct–March); females give birth in dens in Jan–Feb.
- Deer yard up in coniferous areas (limited in WMA's hardwood-dominated landscape).
- Water flow reduced in small streams; larger rivers continue flow.
- Snow unreliable below 2,500 ft elevation.

### Management Practices & Conservation Efforts

**Prescribed Burning:**
- West Virginia authorized prescribed burning on WMAs (2018 law).
- WVDNR uses controlled burns to:
  - Restore oak regeneration (favored by bears, deer, turkeys for acorns).
  - Manage invasive plant species.
  - Enhance wildlife habitat diversity.
  - Promote turkey and grouse brood habitat (open understory).
  - Reduce catastrophic wildfire risk.
- Coordination: WVDNR Wildlife Resources Section works with WV Division of Forestry and federal Forest Service.

**Invasive Species Control:**
- Gypsy moth monitoring (historical defoliation events in WV; egg mass surveys and targeted control).
- Hemlock disease management (woolly adelgid kills eastern hemlock; limited in WMA but regional concern).
- Invasive plant removal (buckthorn, bush honeysuckle, multiflora rose, garlic mustard common in disturbed areas).
- Stream restoration for invasive crayfish, Asian clams (where applicable).

**Habitat Enhancement:**
- Wildlife clearings created and maintained in forested matrix to provide early-successional habitat for turkey, grouse, rabbit.
- Food plots established in some areas for deer and turkey.
- Stream restoration projects to improve aquatic habitat for endangered darters and mussels.
- Wetland development and maintenance for amphibians and waterfowl.

**Timber Management:**
- Selective harvesting and regeneration forestry to maintain forest health, diversity, and wildlife habitat.
- Goal: balance old-growth protection with young-growth creation for diverse age structure.

**Aquatic Species Protection:**
- Monitoring programs for endangered crystal darter and diamond darter populations (ongoing WVU research).
- Habitat restoration in tributaries to improve mussel and darter survival.
- Regulations protecting critical habitat (no fishing, boating, or disturbance in designated zones during sensitive periods—check with WVDNR).
- Partnership with U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service on species recovery.
