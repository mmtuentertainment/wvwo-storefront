# Elk River WMA: Comprehensive Deep-Dive Research Update

## Overview

I have completed exhaustive research into the six critical content gaps you identified. This supplementary report provides **verified, source-cited information** directly from primary regulatory sources, government databases, and expert guidance. All findings are implementation-ready for your public guide.

***

## KEY FINDINGS BY TOPIC

### 1. SPECIFIC TRAIL NAMES \& DESCRIPTIONS ✓ VERIFIED

**Official Documented Trails (WV Trail Inventory Database):**[^1]


| Trail | Length | Type | Status |
| :-- | :-- | :-- | :-- |
| **Tower Falls Trail** | 0.4 mi | Day hike | Improved/maintained |
| **Woodell Trail** | 1.1 mi | Day hike | Improved/maintained |

**Trail Network Details:**

- **30+ miles total interconnected trails** (per WVDNR official statements)
- **Two categories** shown on official maps:

1. **Improved Trails** (solid lines): Well-maintained, marked with blazes, seasonally groomed
2. **Unimproved Hunter Access Trails** (dashed lines): Less formal foot paths, passable but less maintained

**How to Get Detailed Trail Info:**

1. **WV Trail Inventory Web Map** (mapwv.gov/trails/) — searchable by location; shows distance, difficulty, allowed uses, managing agency contact
2. **WVDNR Interactive Hunting Map** (wvdnr.gov) — all trail networks, parking, water access, gates
3. **PDF Map** — contact WVDNR District 3 (304) 924-6211 for official topographic map with all trails labeled
4. **Local Knowledge** — call Holly River SP or Sutton Lake Project Office (USACE) staff

**Sources:**  (WV Trail Inventory official database),  (WVDNR official Elk River WMA map),  (WVDNR official statements)

### 2. FORAGING REGULATIONS ✓ VERIFIED \& CITED

#### **WILD GINSENG — EXPLICITLY PROHIBITED ON WMA**

**Legal Status:** Wild ginseng harvesting is **completely illegal on Elk River WMA** and all West Virginia public lands (state forests, state parks, WMAs).[^2][^3][^4]

**Exact Legal Language:**
> "It is unlawful to plant ginseng or ginseng seed and to dig, collect or gather ginseng on West Virginia public lands, except by land grant university researchers..."[^3][^4]

**Violation Penalties:** \$500–\$2,000 and criminal charges[^5]

**Private Land Reference (for visitor context):**

- Season: Sept 1–Nov 30 only
- Minimum: 5+ years old, 3+ prongs
- Mandatory seed replanting at harvest site
- State certification required
- April 1–Aug 31 possession illegal without weight receipt[^2][^3]

**Sources:**  (WV Forestry Division official),  (WV Code 19-1A-3a),  (State guidance),  (WV Code)

#### **RAMPS (WILD LEEKS) — STATUS UNCLEAR, LIKELY PERMITTED**

**Legal Status on Elk River WMA:** No specific prohibition found in official WVDNR sources.

**General Information:**

- **Season:** Mid-April to early May (when green tops visible above leaf litter)
- **Abundance:** Common in WV Appalachian forests
- **Harvesting:** Both bulb and green top edible; "one leaf per plant" conservation rule commonly recommended[^6]
- **Preparation:** Raw or cooked (soups, salads, sautéed)[^7]

**INFORMATION GAP REMAINS:** No specific ramp harvesting policy for Elk River WMA documented. **Recommend contacting WVDNR District 3 before harvesting to confirm if permitted and any daily limits/area restrictions.**

**Sources:**  (WV Agriculture Dept. official edible plants guide),  (conservation foraging practices)

#### **WILD MUSHROOMS — STATUS UNCLEAR, LIKELY PERMITTED**

**Legal Status on Elk River WMA:** No explicit prohibition found.

**What West Virginia Recognizes:**

- ~1,700 mushroom species documented in state[^8]
- World-class edibles: morels (April–May), king boletes, chanterelles, puffballs[^8][^7]

**Morel Specifics:**

- **Season:** Mid-April to mid-May (brief window)
- **Identification:** Easy — distinctive honeycomb-pitted cap
- **Prep:** Dip in warm saltwater to remove insects; sauté in butter[^7]

**Critical Safety Warning:**

- **NO reliable visual rule** distinguishes poisonous from edible mushrooms[^7]
- Worms inside ≠ edibility indicator[^7]
- Deaths from misidentification occur annually in US[^7]
- **Only harvest if 100% certain or with experienced forager**

**INFORMATION GAP REMAINS:** No specific mushroom foraging policy for Elk River WMA documented. State guidance recommends confirming rules with specific parks/WMAs before harvesting. **Recommend contacting WVDNR before harvesting.**[^9]

**Sources:**  (WVDNR Fungi Overview),  (WV Agriculture Dept. edible plants guide),  (WV News foraging safety),  (general WMA rules)

**Assessment Criteria:**

1. **Running Slope (grade):** <5% = wheelchair-accessible; 5–8% = easy; 8–12% = moderate; >12% = difficult
2. **Cross-slope:** <2% = wheelchair-friendly; 2–5% = moderate; >5% = challenging
3. **Tread:** Paved = best; packed gravel = effort required; dirt = difficult wet; rock/roots = prohibitive
4. **Obstacles:** Width ≥3 feet for wheelchair; no gates blocking passage; bridges level

#### **Elk River WMA ADA Implementation Guidance:**

**Display:**

- Confirm accessibility specifics with WVDNR: "Contact (304) 924-6211 for detailed slope %, surface type, width, and obstacles for Tower Falls and Woodell trails."

4. **Annual Update Cycle:**
    - June of each year: Verify regulations (hunting seasons, drone laws, accessibility improvements)
    - User feedback: Collect trail condition reports, accessibility issues, missing information
    - Refresh: Update guide with new data
5. **Consider Mobile App/Offline Map:**
    - WV Trail Inventory smartphone app coming soon (per ); link to it
