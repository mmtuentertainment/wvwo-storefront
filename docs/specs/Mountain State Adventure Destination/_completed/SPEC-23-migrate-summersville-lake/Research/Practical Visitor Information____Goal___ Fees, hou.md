## Seasonal Operations \& Water Levels

### Summer Pool Schedule

**The lake fills for summer recreation beginning April 1st each year.** Summer pool elevation is **1,652 feet above sea level**, providing **2,790 surface acres of water for recreation.** However, the exact timing of reaching full summer pool depends on rainfall and weather conditions.[^1]

**Historical Summer Pool Achievement:**[^1]

- **Earliest:** April 11 (over the past 25 years)
- **Latest:** May 15 (over the past 25 years)

In particularly dry years, summer pool may be delayed into June or July, so late spring visitors should verify current water levels before planning water-dependent activities.

### Winter Drawdown Schedule

**Winter drawdown begins in November and continues through winter.** The lake is lowered to **elevation 1,575 feet** to provide maximum flood storage capacity for winter snowmelt and spring rains.[^1]

**2024-2025 Deep Drawdown (Special Maintenance):**

A significant deep drawdown occurred in late 2024 to perform critical dam maintenance, including hydraulic cylinder replacement. The lake was drawn to **elevation 1,520 feet** (55 feet below normal winter pool). This type of special drawdown occurs periodically for infrastructure maintenance and may impact boat ramp accessibility.[^5]

### Facility Seasonal Closures

**Battle Run Campground:**[^1]

- Open: **May 1 through Columbus Day (October)**
- Reservable: **Memorial Day weekend through Labor Day**
- Off-season operation: **First-come, first-served basis** before Memorial Day and after Labor Day

## Cell Service \& Connectivity

### Cell Coverage Quality

Cell service at Summersville Lake generally follows the pattern of rural West Virginia, with **reasonable coverage along major routes but spotty service in remote areas.** Service quality depends heavily on your specific location around the lake and your carrier.[^6]

### Carrier Coverage by Strength

Based on coverage mapping for the Summersville/Nicholas County area:[^6]

- **Verizon:** Strongest coverage (approximately 64% reliable coverage)

All three major carriers provide at least basic service along US Route 19, as federal regulations require minimum coverage on major highways.

### Specific Location Recommendations

- **Best signal:** Near US Route 19 and main town areas
