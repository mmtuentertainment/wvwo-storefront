## APPENDIX: HISTORICAL CONTEXT

Holly River State Park's creation represents a significant New Deal conservation success story. Following decades of deforestation by timber operations in the late 1800s, the U.S. Department of Agriculture began land acquisition in 1935-1937. The Works Progress Administration (WPA) employed 250 workers to rehabilitate the land and construct facilities beginning in January 1936.[^5][^4][^1]

The park's nine Legacy cabins, built between 1936-1938, exemplify Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) and WPA craftsmanship, featuring locally quarried stone and hand-hewn logs. These structures achieved National Register of Historic Places designation as part of the "New Deal Resources in West Virginia State Parks and Forests" multiple property listing.[^19][^4][^2]

Swiss immigrants originally settled the area around 1870, clearing timber for farmland. Today's dense forests represent successful 1930s reforestation efforts that transformed degraded agricultural land into the thriving 8,101-acre wilderness visitors enjoy today.[^14][^1]
