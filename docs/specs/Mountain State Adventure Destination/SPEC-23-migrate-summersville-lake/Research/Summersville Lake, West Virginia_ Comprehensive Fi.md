# Summersville Lake, West Virginia: Comprehensive Fishing Guide (2024-2025)

Summersville Lake stands as West Virginia's premier fishing destination, offering 2,700 acres of pristine water with diverse game fish species, excellent seasonal fishing patterns, and well-developed access infrastructure managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers. This comprehensive guide covers fish species verified by West Virginia Division of Natural Resources (WVDNR), current fishing regulations, boat ramp locations with fees, seasonal patterns, major fishing tournaments, and tackle information to help anglers maximize their success at this world-class fishery.

## Fish Species Present and State Records

Summersville Lake hosts a diverse array of game fish species that attract anglers year-round. The lake is home to **smallmouth bass, largemouth bass, spotted bass, walleye, channel catfish, blue catfish, flathead catfish, rainbow trout, brown trout, tiger trout, common carp, yellow perch, crappie, bluegill, and other panfish species**. The lake's exceptional clarity and cool, deep structure create ideal conditions for these species to thrive alongside 60 miles of scenic sandstone cliffs rising up to 70 feet above the waterline.[^1][^2][^3][^4][^5][^6]

The most notable state record from Summersville Lake is the **common carp record, which was caught by Ayden Minick in 2022 at 41.2 inches long and weighing 45.2 pounds**. This record demonstrates the lake's potential for trophy-sized fish. Additionally, **walleye fishing at the lake reflects the populations established through management efforts, though the largest walleye state record for West Virginia (17 pounds 0.82 ounces, 32 inches) was caught from the nearby Kanawha River in 2003**.[^7][^8][^1]

### Seasonal Fishing Patterns

**Spring (March-May)**: Spring represents peak fishing for both smallmouth and largemouth bass, with fish moving into shallower waters for spawning. **Anglers should target points and shallow structure with finesse jigs, green pumpkin soft plastics, and small creature imitations**. Walleye begin their spawn during spring months, concentrating near tailwater areas below Summersville Dam. Crappie provide excellent spring fishing in shallower coves.[^9]

**Summer (June-August)**: During summer, **smallmouth bass and walleye move to deeper water and suspended positions, requiring anglers to downsize baits and fish slower techniques**. **Tube jigs on 1/8-ounce jig heads in watermelon color are particularly effective for schooling fish**. Largemouth bass can be caught around deeper structure and vegetation. **Effective summer lures include tubes, Texas-rigged worms (4-5 inch range), and Bomber crankbaits**. Topwater fishing early morning and late evening produces strikes from largemouth bass.[^10][^11][^6]

**Fall (September-November)**: As water temperatures cool, **walleye concentrate in tailwater areas and hold through spawn, responding well to jigs and minnow imitations**. Smallmouth bass become more aggressive as they feed in preparation for winter, responding to bigger presentations and power fishing techniques. Walleye congregate in deeper water and schools, creating opportunities for larger catches.[^6]

**Winter (December-February)**: Winter fishing requires patience and technique adjustments. **Anglers targeting smallmouth bass should fish slower along the bottom near larger boulders, using downsized crayfish imitations and blade baits**. Winter catches typically yield fewer fish but larger individual specimens as fish school tightly in deeper, warmer water. **Blade baits and finesse presentations prove most effective during cold-water months**.[^12][^6]

## Fishing Regulations: Current Size and Creel Limits

All fishing at Summersville Lake is governed by **2025 West Virginia DNR regulations**. The comprehensive chart above displays the current daily creel limits, minimum size restrictions, and possession limits for all major species. Key regulatory points include:[^13][^14]

**Black Bass Species**: **Daily creel limit of 6 fish in any combination (smallmouth, largemouth, and spotted bass combined), with no minimum size limit and a possession limit of 12 fish**. However, registered bass tournament anglers participating in DNR-permitted tournaments are exempt from certain possession restrictions.[^13]

**Walleye**: **Daily creel limit of 8 walleye with no minimum size limit and a possession limit of 16 fish**. However, it is critical to note that Summersville Lake has **special walleye regulations establishing a slot limit: fish between 20-30 inches must be released, with daily creel limit of 8 fish where only 1 fish over 30 inches may be harvested**.[^14][^13]

**Catfish Species**: Channel catfish have a **daily creel limit of 4 fish with no minimum size and possession limit of 8**. Blue catfish have a **daily creel limit of 2 fish with a 25-inch minimum size**. Flathead catfish have a **daily creel limit of 30 with no minimum size and possession limit of 60**.[^13]

**Trout**: **Daily creel limit of 6 trout (combined species) with no minimum size limit and a possession limit of 12**. Tailwaters below the dam are regularly stocked with trout according to schedule codes BW-F (twice each month February–April, once in January/May, and varying stocking in fall).[^13]

**Crappie and Sunfish**: **Aggregate daily creel limit of 30 fish (black and white crappie combined, bluegill and all other sunfish combined) with no minimum size and possession limit of 60**.[^13]

**Muskellunge**: **Daily creel limit of 1 muskellunge with a 30-inch minimum size and possession limit of 2**. Muskies are present at Summersville Lake though not as commonly targeted as other species.[^13]

### Consumption Advisories

Both **walleye and flathead catfish have meal consumption restrictions due to mercury content—limit to 1 meal per month**. Anglers planning to keep fish for consumption should check current mercury advisory charts before their fishing trip.[^13][^14]

## Boat Ramps, Access Points, and Facilities

## Summary and Recommendations

Summersville Lake represents one of the finest fishing destinations in the eastern United States, offering exceptional species diversity, outstanding water quality, well-maintained public access facilities, and consistent seasonal fishing opportunities. The lake's 2,700 acres of pristine water combined with 60 miles of scenic shoreline create ideal conditions for both recreational and tournament-level fishing.

Success at Summersville Lake depends on understanding seasonal patterns and species-specific techniques. Spring smallmouth and walleye fishing around structure, summer deep-water presentations for suspended fish, fall aggressive fishing as fish feed heavily, and winter patience fishing with downsized presentations all contribute to year-round catch success. The three primary boat ramps with reasonable \$5 day-use fees or \$40 annual passes provide excellent access, while the diversity of tackle shops and nearby services support complete trip planning.

Anglers should review current consumption advisories for walleye and flathead catfish due to mercury content, follow all special walleye slot limit regulations, and respect the lake's catch-and-release areas if designated. Tournament activity provides excellent competition opportunities throughout the fishing season, with WV Bass Nation and WV Bass Federation events contributing to the lake's reputation as a tournament-quality fishery.[^19][^20]
