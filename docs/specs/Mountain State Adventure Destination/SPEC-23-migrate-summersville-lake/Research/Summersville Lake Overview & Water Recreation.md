# Summersville Lake Overview \& Water Recreation

## Lake Specifications and Water Quality

Summersville Lake stands as **West Virginia's largest lake**, offering exceptional water clarity that has earned it the moniker "Little Bahamas of the East" from Skin Diver Magazine. The reservoir, created by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers' construction of Summersville Dam between 1960 and 1966, represents a premier destination for water recreation in the mid-Atlantic region.[^1][^2][^3][^4]

### Physical Characteristics

The lake's dimensions vary seasonally based on operational pool levels managed by the USACE Huntington District. At **summer pool elevation (1,652 feet above sea level)**, the reservoir encompasses **2,700-2,790 surface acres** with over **60 miles of shoreline**. During winter operations, the lake is lowered to **1,575 feet elevation**, reducing the surface area to approximately **928 acres**. This seasonal fluctuation serves multiple purposes including flood control, recreation optimization, and ecological management.[^2][^5][^6][^7][^8]

The lake reaches a **maximum depth of 327 feet** near the base of Summersville Dam, making it not only the largest but also among the deepest reservoirs in West Virginia. While average depth figures are not published in official USACE documentation, the lake's steep-sided topography created by sandstone cliffs results in significant depth variations across the reservoir.[^9][^6][^2]

### Exceptional Water Clarity

Summersville Lake's reputation for crystal-clear water stems from multiple geological and hydrological factors. The reservoir is classified as an **oligotrophic lake**—characterized by low nutrient levels and minimal algal growth—which contributes to its exceptional transparency. **Scuba divers consistently report visibility ranging from 20 to 45 feet during summer months**, with some accounts suggesting visibility can occasionally reach up to 70 feet under optimal conditions.[^3][^10][^11][^1]

The lake has been recognized as "the cleanest, clearest freshwater lake east of the Mississippi River" according to multiple tourism sources citing Skin Diver Magazine. While official Secchi disk readings (the standard scientific measurement of water clarity) are not published in publicly available USACE data, the diver-reported visibility depths substantially exceed those of typical freshwater lakes, which generally range from 1 to 8 meters.[^12][^13][^1][^3]

The extraordinary clarity results from the **sandstone geology** of the surrounding cliffs and lakebed. Unlike limestone-based lakes that can develop algal blooms from calcium carbonate dissolution, or clay-bottomed reservoirs prone to turbidity, Summersville's sandstone foundation minimizes sediment suspension and nutrient loading. The steep cliffs that plunge approximately 100 feet below the water's surface create minimal shallow littoral zones where algae typically proliferate.[^10][^14][^3]

### "Little Bahamas of the East" Designation

This distinctive nickname reflects the lake's remarkable aesthetic qualities—particularly the **aqua-blue coloration** of the water and visibility comparable to tropical marine environments. The comparison to the Caribbean's Bahamas Islands highlights how unusual such water clarity is for a landlocked, temperate freshwater reservoir. The sandstone substrate reflects light in ways that create the signature blue-green hues typically associated with coral reef environments rather than Appalachian mountain lakes.[^15][^10][^12]

## Swimming Areas and Beach Access

Summersville Lake provides designated swimming areas managed by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, with the primary facility being **Battle Run Beach**.[^5][^16]

### Battle Run Beach

Battle Run Beach serves as the lake's main swimming destination, featuring a **1,000-foot sandy beach** located within the Battle Run Recreation Area. This day-use facility operates from **May 1 through Columbus Day (mid-October)**, though peak swimming season runs from June through September when water temperatures are warmest.[^17][^16][^18][^5]

**Beach amenities** include:[^19][^16][^5]

- Vault toilet restrooms with changing areas
- Shower houses (3 facilities serving the adjacent campground)
- Picnic shelters available for reservation (\$70 for Damsite area shelters)
- Picnic tables and grills
- Volleyball facilities
- Kayak launch ramp
- Adjacent boat ramps (A and B)

**Important regulations**:[^5]

- **No lifeguards are provided**—swimming is at your own risk
- **\$5.00 day use fee per vehicle** (annual passes available for \$40)
- Pets and alcohol are **strictly prohibited** at the beach
- Visitors are advised to "always swim with a buddy and always wear a life jacket"
- Swimming is prohibited on boat ramps

The America the Beautiful Pass, along with Golden Age and Golden Access Passport Cards, provides free day use access.[^5]

### Salmon Run Swimming Area

While primarily known as a boat launch facility, **Salmon Run Recreation Area** also accommodates swimming. Located off Airport Road adjacent to U.S. Route 19, this area charges the same **\$5.00 per vehicle day use fee**. Salmon Run distinguishes itself as the **only access point open year-round**, making it popular for winter and early spring visitors. The facility includes approximately 39 car spaces and 20 truck/trailer spaces, vault toilet restrooms, and a two-lane boat launching ramp.[^20][^7][^17][^5]

### Swimming Season and Conditions

The official recreation season aligns with **Battle Run Campground operations from May 1 until Columbus Day** (typically the second Monday in October). However, water temperatures determine practical swimming conditions. Summer water temperatures range from **68-80°F**, with the warmest conditions occurring between late June and early September. Early season swimming (May-early June) remains limited due to cold water temperatures resulting from winter pool drawdown and snowmelt inflow.[^6][^16][^21][^22][^5]

Achievement of summer pool elevation is weather-dependent, with historical data from the past 25 years showing summer pool reached as early as April 11 and as late as May 15. In drought conditions, summer pool may not be achieved until June or July, potentially delaying optimal swimming conditions.[^6]

## Scuba Diving Excellence

Summersville Lake has established itself as a **premier inland scuba diving destination** in the eastern United States, attracting divers from throughout the mid-Atlantic region.[^23][^1][^3]

### Why Summersville Lake is Famous for Scuba Diving

The lake's reputation among divers rests on several unique characteristics:[^24][^3][^23]

1. **Exceptional visibility**: Average summer visibility of 20-45 feet rivals many ocean diving sites and far exceeds typical freshwater lake conditions[^1][^3]
2. **Dramatic underwater topography**: Steep sandstone cliffs descend approximately 100 feet below the surface, creating wall diving opportunities rare in freshwater environments[^14][^3]
3. **Unique geological features**: Divers explore overhangs, boulders, swim-throughs, and rock gardens formed by the flooded Gauley River gorge[^3][^1]
4. **Abundant aquatic life**: The clear water allows excellent viewing of bass, walleye, and catfish populations[^1][^3]
5. **Accessibility**: Unlike remote ocean dive sites, Summersville offers world-class diving within six to eight hours' drive of 60% of the urban U.S. population[^1]

### Visibility Depths and Conditions

**Summer visibility typically ranges from 20 to 45 feet**, depending on rainfall, temperature, and seasonal conditions. Some sources report visibility occasionally reaching 70 feet under optimal conditions. This exceptional clarity results from the oligotrophic nature of the lake and its sandstone substrate, which minimizes turbidity.[^11][^3]

Water temperatures from **June through September range from 78-85°F**, making diving comfortable with minimal thermal protection. The warmer months coincide with the best visibility conditions, establishing **June through September as the prime diving season**.[^25][^22][^3]

### Underwater Features and Dive Sites

The lake's submerged landscape offers diverse diving experiences:[^26][^27][^3]

**Submerged Town of Gad**: The ghost town of Gad, located near the present-day marina, was purchased by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the early 1960s and flooded when Summersville Lake was completed in 1966. The town included homes, farmland, and a post office serving the community from the early 1800s until 1960. During periodic deep drawdowns (approximately every 10 years for dam maintenance), foundations, roadways, and rock carvings become visible. Divers can explore these remnants during normal pool conditions, though sediment coverage varies.[^27][^28][^26]

**Thomas Patrick Wreck**: A small boat intentionally sunk in the 1990s specifically for diver interest, located approximately 30 feet deep near the dam at the winter boat ramp. This artificial reef provides a focal point for training dives and underwater navigation exercises.[^29][^27]

**Natural Dive Sites**:[^3]

- **Long Point Cliff**: The \#1 dive location, featuring dramatic wall descents and excellent visibility
- **Bubble's Cave**: A popular formation offering sheltered diving
- **The Overlook**: Provides panoramic underwater vistas
- **Copperhead Cove**: Known for interesting rock formations
- **The Wall**: Features sheer sandstone cliffs descending deep below the surface


### Dive Shop and Certification Requirements

**Sarge's Dive Shop**, located at the Long Point Marina, serves as the primary diving facility at Summersville Lake. The shop offers:[^30][^31][^3]

- **NAUI and SDI scuba certification classes** for all skill levels
- Equipment sales and rental (regulators, tanks, drysuits, full-face masks)
- Visual and hydro tank inspection services
- Scuba and snorkeling charters to prime lake locations
- Expert instruction with over 100 years of combined dive experience among staff

**Certification is required to dive at Summersville Lake**. Uncertified individuals can complete training through Sarge's Dive Shop or other facilities. The certification process typically includes self-study, academic review, pool skill development, and five open-water training dives. While some dive shops complete training at quarries or travel destinations, Sarge's offers the advantage of on-site certification in the lake's clear waters.[^32][^31][^30]

### Best Diving Months and Conditions

**June through September represents the optimal diving window**. During these months:[^25][^3]

- Water temperatures reach 78-85°F, allowing comfortable diving with 3mm wetsuits[^22][^25]
- Visibility peaks at 20-45 feet average[^3]
- Lake elevation maintains summer pool (1,652 feet), maximizing accessible dive sites[^7]
- Weather conditions are most stable for boat-based diving operations[^3]

Diving is possible outside this window with appropriate thermal protection (3/5mm wetsuit recommended for cooler months), though visibility may decrease and water temperatures drop significantly. Winter pool operations (November-March) lower the lake elevation by 77 feet, altering site accessibility and conditions.[^7][^6][^25]

## Cliff Jumping at Long Point

### Legal Status

**Cliff jumping at Long Point and all other locations at Summersville Lake is strictly prohibited** under regulations enacted by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in 2007. The regulation specifically bans "entering the lake from a height greater than one's own" or more commonly cited as jumping from heights above 6 feet.[^33][^34][^35][^5]

This prohibition applies to all 19 lakes in the USACE Huntington District. **Violators may face citations and fines**, though enforcement has historically focused more on recreational cliff jumpers than on climbers who accidentally fall during deep water soloing activities.[^34][^33][^5]

### Background of the Ban

The cliff jumping ban resulted from **69 water-related deaths between 1993 and 2007** at the 19 Huntington District lakes, including fatalities from drowning, boating accidents, and cliff jumping incidents. The USACE enacted the restriction to address public safety concerns, particularly regarding inexperienced jumpers making impulsive decisions without understanding water depth, rock hazards, or impact forces.[^33]

A significant fatality in 2019 reinforced the ongoing enforcement of this regulation.[^36]

### Cliff Heights at Long Point

The cliffs at Long Point vary considerably in height, ranging from **relatively modest 30-foot sections to imposing 70-foot walls**. The popular deep water soloing (climbing) zones feature routes spanning this entire range, with most climbing activity occurring on 30-50 foot sections.[^21][^34][^33]

Long Point's prominence stems from its dramatic sandstone formations that rise vertically from deep water. The 60-foot cliffs mentioned in tourism materials represent the higher sections frequently photographed for promotional purposes.[^21]

### Safety Considerations

Beyond legal prohibition, cliff jumping at Summersville Lake presents significant safety hazards:[^34][^33][^5]

1. **Impact forces**: Jumping from 30-70 feet generates substantial impact velocities, risking injury even in deep water
2. **Submerged hazards**: Underwater rock formations, particularly near cliff bases, pose collision risks
3. **Water depth variations**: Seasonal pool level changes mean previously safe jump locations can become dangerously shallow
4. **Cold water shock**: Even in summer, sudden immersion can cause involuntary gasping and disorientation
5. **Distance from shore**: Swimmers may underestimate the challenge of returning to accessible shoreline after jumping

The USACE notes a critical distinction between **cliff jumpers (who deliberately leap from high points) and climbers engaged in deep water soloing who may fall accidentally**. While both technically violate the regulation, enforcement has traditionally been more lenient toward climbers using proper technique and safety protocols.[^33][^34]

### Access Trail Information

**Hiking trails provide access to Long Point** from designated trailheads at the Long Point Recreation Area. The trails are open to the public for hiking, sightseeing, and accessing climbing areas. However, these trails do not officially provide access for cliff jumping purposes given the prohibition.[^37][^17][^5]

**Pirates Cove Trail** (0.7 miles, easy to moderate) leads from the parking lot/picnic area to the iconic Pirates Cove section of the lake, with posted warnings that "jumping from cliffs over 6 feet high is strictly prohibited by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers".[^37]

The Long Point area also hosts **Summersville Lake Marina**, offering boat-based access to cliff areas for diving and sightseeing purposes. The \$5.00 boat launching fee applies at Long Point Recreation Area.[^17][^5]

### Current Enforcement and Climbing Distinction

While the cliff jumping ban remains in effect, **rock climbing above the water (deep water soloing) exists in a gray area**. Technically, the regulation prohibits entering the water from above 6 feet, which would include falling while climbing. However, the USACE has shown some recognition of the distinction between climbing as a sport and recreational cliff jumping.[^34][^33]

In 2016, the USACE temporarily lifted the ban to allow the **PsicoRoc deep water soloing competition**, demonstrating willingness to permit organized climbing events with proper safety protocols. Since then, **Appalachian Mountain Guides obtained a permit for "deep water bouldering" trips**, restricting clients to climbing heights of 10-15 feet and requiring attempts to return to the 6-foot mark before falling.[^33][^34]

The unofficial guidance for climbers remains: "climbing technically isn't illegal—it's the falling part that is". Climbers who choose to deep water solo at Summersville do so at legal risk, though enforcement has historically focused on obvious cliff jumping rather than climbing falls.[^34][^33]

## Managing Agency and Contact Information

### Primary Management

**U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, Huntington District** serves as the primary managing agency for Summersville Lake. The Huntington District encompasses 45,000 square miles across parts of five states (West Virginia, Ohio, Kentucky, Virginia, and North Carolina) and operates 35 dams throughout the region.[^4][^38][^39][^5]

Summersville Dam was authorized by Section 4 of the **Flood Control Act of 1938** and constructed between 1960 and 1966 at a cost of nearly \$48 million. President Lyndon B. Johnson dedicated the dam and lake on September 3, 1966. The dam serves multiple authorized purposes: flood risk management, fish and wildlife enhancement, water quality, recreation, and low flow augmentation.[^40][^4][^7]
