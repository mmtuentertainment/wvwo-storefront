## Social Media Strategy for Highway Hunting Shops

**Context**: Content ideas for small hunting shops on Instagram and Facebook
**Sources**: Industry best practices and hunting brand guides

### Platform Selection

**Instagram** (Visual Appeal):

- High-quality photos of hunts, gear, outdoor adventures
- Thriving hunting community with hashtags (#huntinglife, #whitetaildeer)
- Great for brand aesthetics and younger hunters
- 3-5 posts per week (consistency > daily posting)

**Facebook** (Community + Local Reach):

- Best for diverse content: articles, videos, discussion prompts
- Facebook Groups for niche communities (WV hunters, I-79 corridor travelers)
- Live streams and real-time engagement
- Works well for local event promotion

### Content Ideas

**Visual Content**:

- Customer harvest photos (with permission and tags)
- New gear arrivals and unboxings
- Behind-the-scenes of shop operations
- Trail camera footage from local hunting areas
- "Gear of the Week" features

**Engagement Tactics**:

- Q&A sessions via Instagram Stories or Facebook Live
- "Ask Kim Anything" about hunting regs, gear selection, local spots
- User-generated content: encourage hunters to tag shop in their posts
- Polls and quizzes: "Which caliber for WV black bear?" or "Best turkey call?"

**Community Building**:

- Celebrate customer milestones: "First deer with us!" or "10th season shopping here!"
- Repost user-generated content with credit
- Host contests/giveaways (like/share/tag to enter)
- Highlight local conservation efforts or habitat projects

**Educational Content**:

- Hunting regulation updates (season dates, bag limits)
- "How to field dress a deer" videos
- Gear comparison posts ("Budget vs. Premium Optics")
- Local hunting intel: "Best weeks for rut in Nicholas County"

**Authenticity Over Polish**:

- "Keep captions to a paragraph or two - folks don't like reading"
- Tag hunting buddies, sponsors, and gear brands
- Be authentic: "People follow you because they connect with your authentic self"
- Phone-quality photos are acceptable (not everything needs DSLR polish)

### Hashtag Strategy

**General Hunting**:

# huntinglife, #whitetaildeer, #bowhunting, #rifleseason, #turkeyhunting, #bearhunting

**Regional**:

# wvhunting, #appalachianhunting, #westvirginia, #birchriverwv, #mountainstate

**Niche/Species**:

# duckhunting, #deerhunter, #buckseason, #PublicLandHunting

**Local/Shop**:

# wvwildoutdoors, #shoplocal, #familyowned, #fflfirearms, #huntingshop

**Best Practice**: 5-15 relevant hashtags per post (Instagram/TikTok), fewer on Facebook

### Tactics for WVWO

✅ **Instagram Focus**: Showcase Kim's personality, shop aesthetics (weathered wood, blaze orange accents)
✅ **Facebook Groups**: Create "WV Wild Outdoors Hunting Community" for local intel sharing
✅ **User-Generated Content**: "Share your harvest - tag us and we'll feature you!"
✅ **Live Q&A**: "Ask Kim" weekly sessions on regulations, gear, or local spots
✅ **Behind-the-Scenes**: "A day in the life of a DNR agent + shop owner"
✅ **Hashtag Consistency**: Use 8-10 consistent tags on every post for brand recognition

## Red Flags to Avoid (Based on Research)

❌ **Don't**: Use stock photos of models in hunting costumes
✅ **Do**: Use real customer harvest photos and phone-quality authenticity

❌ **Don't**: Write corporate marketing speak ("Unlock your hunting potential!")
✅ **Do**: Write like Kim talks ("Grand love ya - come see us before you head out")

❌ **Don't**: Over-promise on inventory you can't maintain
✅ **Do**: Emphasize "We order what you need" or "Call ahead for specific items"

❌ **Don't**: Ignore out-of-state compliance (leads to legal issues + lost sales)
✅ **Do**: Dedicate a page to FFL transfers with plain-English explanations

❌ **Don't**: Try to compete with Cabela's on product breadth
✅ **Do**: Compete on local expertise, personal service, and convenience

❌ **Don't**: Post daily on social media just to post
✅ **Do**: Post 3-5x/week with purpose (gear, intel, community, behind-scenes)

❌ **Don't**: Use AI slop aesthetics (purple gradients, glassmorphism, Inter font)
✅ **Do**: Use WVWO weathered earth palette, slab serif, handmade energy
