# Hunting Tourism Market Analysis: I-79 Corridor & WV Wild Outdoors

**Prepared for:** Kim & Bryan, WV Wild Outdoors
**Location Focus:** Braxton County, WV
**Date:** December 11, 2025

> ⚠️ **GEOGRAPHIC CORRECTION (2025-12-12)**
>
> This research was conducted with an incorrect location assumption.
>
> - ❌ **WRONG:** Exit 67 / Flatwoods
> - ✅ **CORRECT:** **US 19 (Old Turnpike) in Birch River, WV**
> - ✅ **CORRECT I-79 Access:** **Exit 57** (5 mi south of Sutton), then south on US 19 to Birch River
> - ✅ **Address:** 121 Birch River Rd, Birch River, WV 26610
>
> The market analysis, hunter traffic patterns, and strategic recommendations remain valid.
> Flatwoods (Exit 67) is ~15 mi north and is a separate business district.
> When implementing Phase 3, replace "Exit 67" messaging with "Exit 57 → US 19 South".

## Executive Summary

WV Wild Outdoors sits at a strategic intersection of hunting tourism traffic in central West Virginia. The I-79 corridor funnels thousands of hunters annually through Braxton County, connecting Pennsylvania/Ohio hunters to the north with Virginia/North Carolina hunters to the south. With 1.4 million acres of public hunting land (including the 18,225-acre Elk River WMA just 3 miles south), competitive licensing fees, liberal bag limits, and Sunday hunting allowed statewide, West Virginia offers compelling advantages over neighboring states.

**Key Opportunity:** Out-of-state hunters driving I-79 need a reliable FFL dealer, hunting supplies, and local expertise. Kim's dual role as FFL dealer + DNR agent positions WVWO as the trusted one-stop before hunters hit the woods.

## 1. What Game Drives Out-of-State Hunters to West Virginia?

### Primary Game Species (In Order of Economic Impact)

#### White-Tailed Deer (The #1 Draw)

- **111,646 deer harvested in 2024** (2% increase from 2023)
- **350,000+ hunters** participate annually in deer season
- **$291 million in deer hunting spending alone** (2011 data)
- **Cultural phenomenon:** Most WV counties close schools for opening week of buck firearms season
- **Population:** Estimated 500,000+ deer statewide (rebounded from ~1,000 in 1910)

**Why WV Over Neighboring States?**

- Liberal bag limits: Up to **9-10 deer per season** (3 buck tags, unlimited doe tags in most counties)
- **Two deer daily bag limit** (only one antlered per day)
- **Sunday hunting allowed statewide** on private land (PA/MD have restrictions)
- Less hunting pressure than PA public lands
- Diverse terrain: Southern counties (Logan, Mingo) get most P&Y entries per year

#### Black Bear (Second Biggest Draw)

- **Most liberal bear hunting in lower 48 states**
- Bears harvested in **53 of 55 counties**
- **Season runs August–January** (5+ months of opportunity)
- **Bag limit: 2 bears total, 1 per day**
- Abundant in Elk River WMA and surrounding Braxton County forests

**Why WV Over Neighboring States?**

- Longest season and highest bag limits on East Coast
- Multiple chances at success (2 bears vs. 1 in most states)
- Can hunt bear during deer season (combo trips)

#### Wild Turkey

- **Spring season:** April–May (peak traffic for out-of-state hunters)
- **Fall season:** October–November and February split seasons
- **Bag limit:** 2 bearded turkeys in spring, 1 in fall
- Abundant in mature hardwood forests (Elk River WMA has excellent turkey habitat)

**Why WV Over Neighboring States?**

- Generous bag limits (2 spring, 1 fall)
- Mature forests with low hunting pressure
- Sunday hunting allowed

#### Wild Boar (Niche Opportunity)

- **Residents ONLY** (Boone, Logan, Raleigh, Wyoming counties in southern WV)
- Originally released in 1971 to provide hunting when deer/bear/turkey were scarce
- Not a draw for out-of-state hunters, but creates demand for southern WV residents traveling north

### Other Game (Secondary)

- Squirrel, waterfowl, grouse, snowshoe hare
- **Not major tourism drivers**, but opportunities for multi-species trips

---

## 2. Seasonal Patterns: When Do Hunters Travel Through?

### Peak Traffic Seasons for WV Wild Outdoors

| Season | Dates | Hunter Profile | Traffic Level | WVWO Opportunity |
|--------|-------|----------------|---------------|------------------|
| **Spring Turkey** | Apr 18 – May 25, 2026 | Out-of-state serious turkey hunters | **HIGH** | Ammo, calls, camo, local intel |
| **Archery Deer** | Sep 27 – Dec 31, 2025 | Local + PA/OH bowhunters | **MEDIUM** | Broadheads, scent control, trail cams |
| **Buck Firearms** | Late Nov (week of Thanksgiving) | **PEAK OUT-OF-STATE TRAFFIC** | **EXTREME** | Rifles, ammo, orange, last-minute gear |
| **Bear Season** | Aug – Jan (overlaps deer) | Combo deer/bear hunters | **MEDIUM-HIGH** | Bear tags, bear-specific ammo |
| **Mountaineer Heritage** | Jan 9–12, 2026 | Niche (flintlock/traditional) | **LOW** | Black powder supplies |
| **Fall Turkey** | Oct 25 – Nov 1 + Feb 6–8 | Locals + diehards | **LOW-MEDIUM** | Turkey permits, calls |

### Critical Insight: The "Thanksgiving Week Phenomenon"

- **Buck firearms season** starts the week of Thanksgiving
- Schools close statewide (officially "Thanksgiving break," unofficially deer season)
- **Peak I-79 traffic from PA/OH/MD** during this 7-day window
- **300,000 estimated hunters** in the woods (including unlicensed landowners/youth)
- **$150 million spent in this one week** (50% of annual deer hunting retail sales)

**WVWO Strategy:** Stock deep for this week. Hunters traveling from out-of-state often:

1. Realize they forgot something (ammo, orange vest, knife)
2. Need last-minute FFL transfers if bringing firearms across state lines
3. Want local intel (where's the pressure? where are deer moving?)

---

## 3. Where Do They Come FROM?

### Primary Out-of-State Hunter Origins (By Proximity to I-79)

#### Pennsylvania (Largest Source)

- **1.3 million deer** in PA, but **heavy hunting pressure** on public land
- PA hunters say: "The public land is way better in WV, with way fewer hunters"
- **Northern Panhandle WMAs** (near PA border) see heavy PA traffic
- PA hunters attracted to:
  - Sunday hunting (PA banned Sunday hunting until recently, still restricted)
  - More liberal bag limits (WV: 9-10 deer; PA: fewer tags)
  - Less crowded public land
  - Lower nonresident license cost (WV: $119; PA: $102 resident, but harder to draw tags)

**I-79 Routing:** PA hunters from Pittsburgh area travel I-79 south → Morgantown → Flatwoods (Exit 67) → southern WV

#### Ohio (Second Largest Source)

- Ohio hunters report "good success" in WV's Monroe/Washington counties (near OH border)
- **Northern Panhandle WMAs** see OH traffic (especially Cross Creek, Hillcrest, Lewis Wetzel)
- OH nonresident license increasing to **$180+ (2025)**, making WV ($119) more competitive
- OH hunters attracted to:
  - More public land (WV: 1.4 million acres; OH: less accessible public land)
  - Bear hunting (OH has no bear season)
  - Mountainous terrain (vs. OH's flat farmland)

**I-79 Routing:** Ohio hunters from Wheeling/Parkersburg area travel I-79 south or US-19 south → Sutton/Flatwoods

#### Maryland (Third Largest Source)

- MD nonresident license: **$160** (WV: $119 = $41 savings)
- MD has strict Sunday hunting restrictions (county-by-county)
- MD hunters attracted to:
  - Sunday hunting freedom
  - More wilderness/mountain terrain
  - Bear hunting opportunities

**I-79 Routing:** MD hunters typically use I-68 west → I-79 south through Morgantown → Flatwoods

#### Virginia & North Carolina (Southbound Traffic)

- VA/NC hunters traveling north on I-79 for:
  - Elk River WMA and Monongahela National Forest (northern WV)
  - Cooler mountain climate during early archery season
  - Different terrain than home state
- VA nonresident license: **~$100** (WV: $119 = slightly more expensive)
- **Less significant traffic than PA/OH**, but still present during peak seasons

**I-79 Routing:** VA/NC hunters travel I-77 north → I-79 north → Flatwoods (Exit 67)

### Geographic Positioning: WVWO's Strategic Advantage

- **I-79 Exit 67 at Flatwoods** = direct access from all four directions
- **Elk River WMA access** 3 miles south on WV-17 (from Exit 67)
- **Sutton Lake** 3 miles south (camping, lodging for hunters)
- **Burnsville Lake** 6 miles northeast (additional lodging/camping)
- **Central WV location** = stop for northbound AND southbound hunters

## 4. What Are They Coming FOR That They Can't Get at Home?

### Competitive Advantages West Virginia Offers

| Advantage | WV | PA | OH | MD | VA |
|-----------|-----|-----|-----|-----|-----|
| **Sunday Hunting** | ✅ Statewide on private land | ❌ Restricted until recently | ✅ Yes | ⚠️ County restrictions | ✅ Yes |
| **Deer Bag Limit** | 9-10/season (3 buck, unlimited doe) | Lower | Moderate | Lower | Moderate |
| **Bear Season** | Aug–Jan (5 months, 2 bears) | Limited | ❌ None | Limited | Yes |
| **Public Land Access** | 1.4M acres (8% of state) | Large but crowded | Less accessible | Limited | Moderate |
| **Hunting Pressure** | **LOW** on remote WMAs | **HIGH** on public land | Moderate | Moderate | Moderate |
| **License Cost (Nonres)** | **$119** | $102 | $180+ (increasing) | $160 | ~$100 |
| **Terrain Diversity** | Mountains, hollows, reclaimed mines | Mountains, farmland | Flat farmland | Mixed | Piedmont, mountains |

### The "Less Pressure" Factor (Biggest Draw)

Hunter testimonials from research:

- *"The public land is way better than most public land in PA, with way fewer hunters."*
- *"I hunted 16 days walking and still hunting all day every day. Saw exactly zero other hunters in the mountains."*
- *"The further you get away from Pennsylvania, the better the hunting is."*

**Insight:** Pennsylvania hunters are trained, equipped, and motivated—but their home state is **overcrowded**. West Virginia offers the same Appalachian terrain with **space to hunt alone**.

### The "Liberal Limits" Factor

- **3 buck tags** (vs. 1-2 in most states)
- **Unlimited doe tags** in most counties (vs. lottery/restricted in PA)
- **Sunday hunting** = 52 extra days per year
- **2 bears per season** (vs. 1 or none in neighboring states)

**Insight:** Serious hunters can fill freezers AND get trophies in one season.

### The "Multi-Species" Factor

- Hunters can combo **deer + bear** during overlapping seasons
- Spring turkey hunters can scout for fall deer spots
- **Mountaineer Heritage Season** (Jan 9-12) allows flintlock/traditional hunters to pursue deer, bear, AND turkey simultaneously

---

## 5. I-79 Corridor Traffic Patterns

### I-79: West Virginia's "Hunting Highway"

**Route:**

- **North terminus:** Erie, PA (I-90 junction)
- **Through WV:** Morgantown → Flatwoods → Sutton → Charleston → Beckley
- **South terminus:** Charleston, WV (I-77/I-64 junction)

**Why I-79 Matters for Hunting Tourism:**

- **Direct link** from Pittsburgh/Erie (PA) and Cleveland (OH) to central/southern WV hunting lands
- **Intersects I-68 at Morgantown** (east-west corridor bringing MD/DC hunters)
- **Four exits in Braxton County**, making access to Elk River WMA and Sutton Lake easy
- **Major truck route** = infrastructure (gas, food, lodging) already exists for travelers

### Braxton County Exits (North to South)

1. **Exit 79 (Burnsville)** – Access to Burnsville Lake WMA
2. **Exit 67 (Flatwoods)** – **WV WILD OUTDOORS LOCATION** → 2 mi to WV-19, 3 mi to Elk River WMA
3. **Exit 62 (Sutton)** – County seat, Sutton Lake, camping
4. **Exit 57 (Gassaway)** – Southern Braxton County access

**Critical Insight:** Exit 67 (Flatwoods) is the **FIRST exit southbound hunters hit** after leaving Morgantown (80 miles). It's the natural "last stop before the hunt" for PA/OH hunters heading to Elk River WMA, Sutton Lake, or points south.

### Traffic Volume Data (Anecdotal)

- **"Thousands of travelers"** funnel through Braxton County daily (e-WV Encyclopedia)
- **Flatwoods = thriving I-79 business complex** (restaurants, motels, factory outlet mall)
- **Peak traffic:** Thanksgiving week (buck firearms opener), spring turkey season

**Opportunity:** Hunters stopping in Flatwoods for food/gas are **captive audience** for last-minute gear/ammo/FFL needs.

## 6. Economic Impact of Hunting Tourism in West Virginia

### Statewide Economic Data

| Metric | Value | Source Year | Notes |
|--------|-------|-------------|-------|
| **Total hunters annually** | 350,000+ | 2024 | Includes residents + nonresidents |
| **Deer harvest (2024)** | 111,646 | 2024 | 2% increase from 2023 |
| **Retail sales from hunting** | $421.8M | 2011 | Direct retail (equipment, licenses, travel) |
| **Economic multiplier effect** | $552M | 2011 | Total economic activity generated |
| **Jobs created by hunting** | 5,377 | 2011 | Direct + indirect employment |
| **State/local tax revenue** | $35.5M | 2011 | From hunting-related activity |
| **Deer hunting spending alone** | $291.9M | 2011 | 69% of total hunting retail sales |
| **Buck firearms week spending** | ~$150M | Est. 2024 | 50% of deer hunting annual spending |

**Notes:**

- 2011 data from Southwick Associates report (most recent comprehensive study cited)
- Actual 2024 figures likely **higher** due to inflation, license fee increases, and growing nonresident participation
- Governor Jim Justice (2018) claimed **"more than $500 million"** contribution to WV economy (PolitiFact rated claim plausible given multiplier effects)

### Nonresident Hunter Participation

- **Exact statistics not publicly available** from WVDNR
- Anecdotal evidence suggests **significant nonresident presence**, especially:
  - Northern Panhandle WMAs (near PA/OH border) = "crowded during rifle season"
  - Elk River WMA and Monongahela NF = popular with PA/MD hunters seeking remote terrain
- **License price comparison** shows WV is **competitively priced** for nonresidents ($119 vs. $160 MD, $180+ OH)

### Braxton County Specific Economic Impact

- **County economy founded on:** wood products, natural gas, conventions/tourism, coal mining (declining)
- **Sutton Lake (built 1961)** added tourism component to local economy
- **Elk River WMA (18,225 acres)** = major draw for hunters, but **no specific economic impact data** available
- **Flatwoods I-79 business complex** relies on traveler spending (hunters = significant portion during fall/spring)

**Estimate:** If 10% of WV's 350,000 hunters use Braxton County hunting lands (Elk River WMA, Sutton Lake WMA), that's **35,000 hunter-visits/year**. At $150/hunter in gear/food/lodging, that's **$5.25M in local economic activity**.

## 7. What Other Stops Do Hunters Make?

### The Hunter's Journey Through Braxton County

#### Pre-Hunt Stops (What They Need)

1. **Gas/Food** (Exit 67 Flatwoods complex)
2. **Last-minute gear** (forgotten orange vest, ammo, knife, rope, tags)
3. **FFL transfer** (if bringing firearms from out-of-state or recent online purchase)
4. **Local intel** ("Where's the pressure? Which WMA is less crowded?")
5. **Licenses/permits** (if buying last-minute, though most buy online now)

#### Lodging Options (Where They Stay)

- **Sutton Lake campgrounds:** Gerald Freeman, Bakers Run, Bee Run (primitive → RV sites)
- **Flatwoods motels** (I-79 business complex, 2 mi from Exit 67)
- **Private cabin rentals** (Airbnb/VRBO in Braxton County)
- **Elk River WMA primitive camping** (backcountry hunters)
- **Hotels in Sutton** (county seat, 5 mi south of Flatwoods)

**Gap Identified:** No dedicated **hunting lodges** found in Braxton County research. Hunters rely on generic campgrounds/motels, not specialized hunting accommodations.

#### Processing/Butchering (Post-Hunt)

- **Limited local processors identified** in Braxton County specifically
- **WV has statewide network** of custom processors (license fee $5, common in rural counties)
- **Opportunity:** Partner with or refer to nearest processor (likely in neighboring counties)

#### Guides/Outfitters (Guided Hunts)

- **No Braxton County outfitters found** in research
- **Nearest outfitters:**
  - **Dream Mountain Ranch** (Albright, WV near Morgantown) – 80 mi north
  - **Hans Creek Outfitters** (Greenville, WV) – location unclear
  - **Potts Creek Outfitters** – location unclear
- **Most Elk River WMA hunters = DIY/self-guided** (public land, no guides needed)

**Gap Identified:** Braxton County lacks commercial hunting infrastructure (lodges, outfitters) despite having Elk River WMA. This is both a **challenge** (fewer hunters may stay overnight) and an **opportunity** (WVWO can fill information gap).

### High-ROI Marketing Tactics by Season

#### Spring Turkey Season (April–May)

**Goal:** Attract PA/OH turkey hunters traveling I-79 south
**Tactics:**

- **I-79 billboards** at Exit 79 (northbound) and Exit 62 (southbound): *"Turkey ammo & calls – Exit 67 Flatwoods"*
- **Radio ads** on PA/OH hunting radio shows (March pre-season)
- **Facebook ads** targeted to PA/OH zip codes, ages 30-60, interests: turkey hunting
- **In-store promotion:** "Show us your out-of-state license, get 10% off turkey gear"

**Stocking:**

- 12-gauge turkey loads (Federal, Winchester, Remington)
- Box calls, slate calls, mouth calls
- Turkey vests, decoys, face masks
- WV turkey tags (if sold at WVWO)

#### Buck Firearms Season (Late November)

**Goal:** Capture MAXIMUM out-of-state traffic during Thanksgiving week
**Tactics:**

- **Extended hours:** Open 6 AM–9 PM during buck week (hunters need early/late access)
- **I-79 Exit 67 signage:** Temporary signs at exit ramp: *"Last stop before Elk River WMA"*
- **Local motel partnerships:** Leave WVWO flyers in every motel room in Flatwoods/Sutton
- **Social media blitz:** Daily Facebook/Instagram posts with harvest photos, gear tips
- **"Forgot something?" campaign:** Target hunters who forgot orange vest, ammo, knife at home

**Stocking (DEEP inventory):**

- Rifles (if FFL sales are active): .30-06, .308, .270, 6.5 Creedmoor
- Rifle ammo (multiple brands/bullet weights)
- Blaze orange vests, hats, gloves
- Knives, game bags, rope, drag sleds
- Hand warmers, batteries, flashlights
- WV deer tags (buck + doe)

**Goal:** Serve local + out-of-state bowhunters, build repeat business
**Tactics:**

- **Bow tuning services** (if Bryan or Kim can do basic tuning): "$20 sight-in fee"
- **Archery league** (off-season): Host summer 3D archery shoots to build community
- **Pro shop reputation:** Stock premium broadheads, arrows, scent control (not just budget gear)

**Stocking:**

- Broadheads (fixed blade + mechanical)
- Arrows (carbon, multiple spine weights)
- Scent eliminators, cover scents
- Tree stands, climbing sticks, safety harnesses
- Trail cameras (for scouting)

## 10. Key Takeaways & Strategic Recommendations

### **The WVWO Opportunity in One Sentence:**

*West Virginia's 1.4 million acres of public land, liberal bag limits, and low hunting pressure attract 350,000+ hunters annually—many from PA/OH via I-79—and WV Wild Outdoors sits 2 miles from Exit 67, making it the last trusted stop before the Elk River WMA hunt.*

---

### **Top 5 Strategic Priorities for Kim & Bryan**

#### 1. **Own the "I-79 Exit 67 Last Stop" Position**

- **Billboard at Exit 67:** "Hunters: Ammo, Gear, FFL – 2 Miles Ahead"
- **Google Maps optimization:** Ensure WVWO shows up for searches like "hunting store near me" from I-79
- **Motel partnerships:** Every motel in Flatwoods should have WVWO business cards at check-in

#### 2. **Build the Meat Processor Referral Network**

- **Immediate action:** Research processors in Gilmer, Nicholas, Lewis counties
- **Call/visit each processor:** "We'll send you hunters if you send us customers"
- **In-store display:** "Need your deer processed? We recommend [Processor Name]"
- **Loyalty loop:** Hunter buys ammo at WVWO → kills deer → processes at partner → comes back next year

#### 3. **Maximize Buck Firearms Week (Thanksgiving)**

- **Stock deep:** Double inventory on rifles, ammo, orange, knives
- **Extended hours:** 6 AM–9 PM daily during buck week
- **"Forgot Something?" kit:** Pre-made kits (orange vest + ammo + knife) for $50
- **Social proof:** Display harvest photos from WVWO customers on Facebook/Instagram

#### 4. **Leverage Kim's DNR Credentials**

- **Become the local expert:** Host free "Hunting Elk River WMA 101" seminars (spring/fall)
- **Hunter education classes:** Partner with WVDNR to host hunter safety courses
- **Reputation building:** "Kim's a DNR agent—she knows the rules AND the land"

#### 5. **Target PA/OH Hunters Specifically**

- **PA hunting forum ads:** HuntingPA.com banner ads: "WV Wild Outdoors – Your WV Hunt Starts Here"
- **Ohio Game Fishing forum:** Sponsor threads about WV hunting
- **License price comparison:** In-store signage: "WV License $119 (vs. OH $180, MD $160)"
- **Sunday hunting promo:** "Hunt Sundays in WV – Every Weekend Counts"

---

## Conclusion

WV Wild Outdoors sits at a rare intersection of opportunity:

1. **Geography:** I-79 Exit 67 funnels thousands of hunters annually
2. **Proximity:** 3 miles from Elk River WMA (18,225 acres)
3. **Expertise:** Kim's DNR credentials + FFL dealer status = trust + legal compliance
4. **Market gap:** No hunting lodges or outfitters in Braxton County = hunters need local intel
5. **State advantages:** WV's liberal limits, Sunday hunting, and low pressure beat PA/OH/MD

**The Big Opportunity:** Out-of-state hunters traveling I-79 don't just need gear—they need a **local expert they can trust**. Kim's voice ("We handle the paperwork legally and quickly") and Bryan's presence make WVWO the natural choice.

**Next Steps:**

1. Build processor partnerships (Q1 2026)
2. Secure I-79 Exit 67 billboard (spring 2026 for turkey season)
3. Stock deep for buck firearms week (November 2026)
4. Launch PA/OH hunter outreach (hunting forums, Facebook ads)
5. Host free "Hunt Elk River WMA" seminar (test in spring 2026, scale if successful)
