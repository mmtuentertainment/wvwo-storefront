It was nice.  We stayed in a cabin for just a few nights.  Nice cabin!  (Thanks you Lord so much!)  And, Peaceful!  Plenty of room!  Cabin was just a few miles out of Pigeon Forge.  We went to the Hatfield and McCoy dinner show.  Bryan and BJ liked, but now so me!  I liked the show, but way to expensive for what it was.  We had seen Dixie Stampede in the past.  Expensive, but it was - well - I guess it was worth it.
You sent

Bryan is trying to do way too much.  1 job - Bryan's friend Tom, originally from your area, wants Bryan to help replace a roof on a church.  2 - job Mike and Bryan's cousin, single woman, Suzie Frame wants her roof/siding done on her home/cabin in Birch River.  3 job - Elder woman Judy Evans at church needs her roof fixed.  It is leaking bad.  4 job - Elder and widow Barb Flint needs a roof repair on a building that she husband thought so much of.  5 job - Church needs a 120 ft culvert replaced.  Roadway/driveway to church in Tesla washed away with the flood.  6 job - We have over 25,000 lbs. potatoes planted.  Some may not make it, but a lot did.  Time to harvest and try to locate buyers or storage facility.  Beside all of the jobs that he has on his list to do, we are still cleaning four parks and running the store.  The store should be picking up more soon.  He is getting to many things on his list to do.  He gets grouchy!
Bryan
After hunting season, if in the Lord's will, I really hope that the good Lord lets us take a break.  Vanessa doing ok, too?  Ya'll just work away.  When are you going to come our way?  Anytime soon?

Karen actually talked to me about an hour the other day.  She even mentioned Mike in a few conversations.  Sometimes, she seems like she does ok and then, sometimes, you just don't know what she is going to say or do.  I think that she is doing a little better.  It may not hurt to see if Bryan can build him something back at that location.  Did you see our little storefront??  That may be big enough just to use as a camp until he builds something back.

Bryan and I was going to have a double dinner date, like a dinner with a friend and family-Mike.  It would do them both good just to think about something else for a couple hours.

Matt, I think that it may have been my Mom, anyway, Bryan and I were told to go pay our taxes at the Braxton County Courthouse.  Bryan said, "Did you not pay all our taxes?"  I told him that I thought that I did, but was unsure.  So, we stopped at the Courthouse earlier today.  We didn't owe taxes, but Jerry, Tori, and your Dad owed.  I texted Tonya and mentioned that they owed taxes.  Bryan paid Tori's car taxes.  Bryan called your Dad.  Mike said that he thought that you had paid them.  Bryan asked Mike if he wanted him to pay so it would not go into default.  If that is the right word for what they do????  Anyway, Bryan paid the property tax.  I will look it up and you can pay him back.  I do know that if you wait too long that it gets to be a pretty good penny.  On the receipt, I noticed that the Sheriff's Department charged $20 for just the advertisement in the newspaper.  That was additional $20 for Mike's and $20 for Victoria's advertisement notice.  When it goes to the state, it cost $1,000+.  In addition, you still have your taxes and other fees.  So, hopefully, the amount we paid saved you quite a bit.  I will get back with you and you can send Bryan the money.

Matt, I also try to pay all our property taxes July 15 or that week or by the end of July each year to get them paid.  Suggestion for you to do the same since you have so many properties to keep up with!  I know that Ohio's property taxes are so much higher, but you can try to save prior to July to get an idea of what you need to pay, if in the Lord's will.

Is everything working out with your Dad getting a replacement car?  How is the girl that was in the accident?  It sounded that she did get hurt somewhat.  Hope she is doing ok now!  Are you all doing ok?

How is Mike healing?

Tracy's Mom passed on Sunday, May 28.  BJ and Tori are out of college right now.  Victoria is to finish her Bachelor's in December, if in the Lord's will.  She is working at a good job with Veterans.  It is a state job, not federal, but she applied for a position at a university.  She had two interviews.  And, she is moving near the university.  The university had seen how many sports that she had been in and asked her to apply for coaching positions, even softball when the positions come open.  So, she is excited.
Bryan
BJ is back to work at the same company that he had worked for in land surveying.  This is his third summer.  He has another year or so.
Bryan
Tori, she is applying to go on to study to be a physician assistant or physical therapist.

Kasandra has lost ALL her parental rights just recently.  Bryan and I still get to see the munchkins, but now all of them.
Bryan
Bre and Jordan stayed with Bryan and me for a little while.  Well, on-and-off!  But, they recently moved back to Webster County.  His house had burnt so now they are living in a camper.
You sent
What did Kasandra do now
Bryan
Kasandra didn't do anything.  And, I am not taking up for her.  When Bryan and I was in Hawaii, she had Court.  We couldn't attend, but our lawyers did.  Court ordered for her to continue drug testing.  She continued as Court Ordered.  In February, another hearing was held.  At the end of the hearing, everyone -- EVERYONE --- was still in the Courtroom.  Judge commented that NO MORE DRUG TESTING NEEDED TO BE DONE.  Well, that was a trick.  Just as we have seen over-and-over for two years to four years!  And, I am not making excuses, you ask Bryan.  You would not believe what we are seeing in Court and what we had seen and experienced.  Anyway, at the March/April hearing, Judge Alsop asked Kasandra when she was on the stand if she was Court Ordered to take drug testing in January.  Kasandra commented that at the last hearing that he stated that NO ONE WAS TO DRUG TEST ANY LONGER.  Bryan and I both heard it and so didn't everyone else.  Judge interrupts her and stops her from speaking so it would not be recorded by the transcriber.  He asked the same and she said the same.  He interrupted her again and stopped her.  Anyway, I could write a book and that is most likely what I am going to do because what is going on needs to be brought to the American people's attention.
Bryan
If anyone should be drug tested, it should be every single person having anything to do with the children at all.  I mean everyone.  Grandparents, parents, all lawyers, Judge, Guardian Ad Litem, CPS workers, Prosecuting Attorney, etc.  All need drug tested!
Bryan
Kids were split up.  It's still a mess.  The state hires people that are either weird, uneducated, unexperienced, no children themselves, etc.  It's a mess!
Bryan
Well, got to get back to work!  Prayers!
Bryan
Matt, the taxes we paid were $165.65 plus credit card fee of $5.  The total amount for Mike's property is $170.65.
Bryan
That amount is just Mike's, not Tori's.

We just got back from Youngstown.  Bryan called him last night and he said that Mike was in the hospital.  We were going to stay with him and spend the weekend, but Bryan said since that he was in the hospital that we would come home.  We were at Youngstown State University until about 10 pm last night.  We drove back to Washington PA and stayed in a hotel.  We just did get back.  We didn't plan because we just didn't know if we were going to be able to go until the last minute.  We had to clean three of the federal parks yesterday before we headed that way.  BJ's college indoor track race started at 1 pm so we were pushing the time.  And, what luck?  We had a blowout on the way up and had to stop at the Racetrack Rd in Washington PA.  We were stuck a few hours and then still headed to Youngstown.  We were beat and so Bryan said with Mike being in the hospital that we just come back home and work.  Bryan talked to him on the phone for a little while.  Bryan said that he couldn't understand him completely.  He didn't know if he was on some meds or just not felling well.

Bryan
We are planning on leaving at Christmas, if in the Lord's will.  With working the hours we do during 3/4 of the year, after Christmas is the best time for us to take a vaca.
Bryan
Is he going to church and getting active for Christmas?
Bryan
Mike's cousins are in this area.  Susie just retired.  She is also by herself.
Bryan
It would be good for him to spend a little time down here, if it would be in the Lord's will.

Mike is going to have to get better before he does anything.  He is not a spring chicken.  Right now, he needs to rest and focus on getting better.

Hey, I was telling someone about the store and realized I don't know how long you all have been running it. And what are your hours? I know weekdays but wasn't sure about Saturdays
Bryan
10 AM- 5 PM   We started our store in 2008.
You sent
Oh nice, 2008! That's a good run. Is that 10-5 on Saturdays too or just weekdays?
Bryan
Yes, but most people who are regulars know that we take care of the parks and we have a big family.  Sometimes, we run late or have to close for family/Church events.
You sent
Ha, that's fair - family first. The person asked what kind of store it is. How do you usually describe it when someone asks?
Bryan
Sporting goods/country store!  We started out as a sporting goods store for all sports in Fayetteville-Fayette County (New River Gorge area).  We moved to Hico (still in Fayette Co).  Couldn't make it at that location!  Moved closer to home in I believe 2013 to Birch River.  Opened and went through the flood in 2006 and lost over $70,000 wholesale with FEMA not helping due to being commercial and shortly thereafter over a $10,000 theft loss with no insurance to cover.  Besides, with all the stuff with the girls and grandkids!  But, Matthew - my GOD IS INDEED GOOD ALL THE TIME!  We were awarded the federal contract and was able to rebuild and restore!  Now, our overhead is a handful!  That's God!  We own the building and own every single thing in the building - except the little bit of deer feed that just walked through the door.  LOL!  Matt, always keep your chin up!  I have learned when things are rough, you still praise God Almighty!  When a door closes, definitely look for the blessing because it indeed will come!  God is so, so, so good!  I love my Lord!  Grand love ya!

"Dang Kim, I didn't know all that. $70k in the flood and then a theft right after? And FEMA wouldn't help because it was commercial? That's brutal. The fact you came back from that says a lot. I needed to hear that honestly - been in my head a lot lately, you know how I get with the anxiety stuff. Sometimes feels like I'm just treading water and can't see the next door opening. You mentioned 'all the stuff with the girls and grandkids' - how's everyone holding up? How's Bre and her guy getting along?"
Bryan
All is good!  Bre and her fellow works construction.  Bre said that someone didn't pay for their work for four months.  Well, she didn't pay for all of it.  It is going to be a big bite for them two.  They were trying to help her, but now, when she may need someone in the future, it won't happen.  Those two do very good work.
You sent
Man, four months with no pay? That's brutal. I know how that goes - I went 15 months with no rent on three properties during the pandemic. People just stopped paying and the government said you couldn't do anything about it. Almost lost everything. So yeah, I feel for them. What's his name? If I ever need work done when I'm down there, I'd rather give money to family than some random contractor.

I will keep you in mind for flyers.   You did awesome.  You can offer that also to your Church and other businesses.  Advertising is needed.
