## Tech Stack (Simple)

- **Framework**: Astro 5.x (static site generator)
- **Styling**: Tailwind CSS 4.x
- **Hosting**: Cloudflare Pages (free, unlimited bandwidth)
- **Forms**: Web3Forms (free contact form)
- **Domain**: wvwildoutdoors.com

No databases. No Docker. No CMS. No servers to maintain.

Matthew manages updates directly in the code when needed.

## Future Ideas (Only If Wanted)

These are NOT planned - just possibilities if Kim ever asks:

- Product catalog page (static, updated by Matthew)
- Blog/news section (static markdown posts)
- Newsletter signup (Buttondown or similar)

But honestly? The site does what it needs to do. Don't over-engineer a family gift.
