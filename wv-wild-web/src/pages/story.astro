          From a small shop on the back roads
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          WV Wild Outdoors is a small, family-run hunting and outdoor shop serving Birch River, Little Birch, and the back roads in between. Over the years, the shop became a practical waypoint where locals picked up firearms, ammo, hunting gear, and the everyday odds and ends that keep farms, camps, and seasons running.

          Through the 2016 flood
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          In June 2016, severe flooding hit this part of West Virginia, including communities in and around Birch River and Nicholas County. The family’s original Little Birch shop building next door took on damage in that flood. But in these hills, mud cleans off.
        </p>
        <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Rather than close the doors for good, they bought the corner lot just down the road and moved WV Wild Outdoors there—mud and all—keeping the shop close to the same neighbors, hunters, and families who had always depended on it.

          Still here for the next season
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Today, WV Wild Outdoors continues in that newer corner-lot location as a straightforward, local shop run by people who know the area they serve. Whether it’s getting sighted in for buck season, grabbing a bag of deer corn, or just stopping by to talk shop, the goal is the same: make it easy for locals to get what they need without leaving the hills and hollows they call home.
