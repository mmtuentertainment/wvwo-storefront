          From a small shop on the back roads to a new corner lot
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          WV Wild Outdoors is a small, family-run hunting and outdoor shop
          serving Birch River, Little Birch, and the back roads in between.
          Over the years, the shop has become a practical waypoint where locals
          pick up firearms, ammo, hunting gear, and the everyday odds and ends
          that keep farms, camps, and seasons running.

          Through the 2016 flood and a move down the road
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          In June 2016, severe flooding hit this part of West Virginia,
          including communities in and around Birch River and Nicholas County.
          The family’s original Little Birch shop building next door took on
          damage in that flood. Rather than close the doors for good, they
          bought the corner lot just down the road and moved WV Wild Outdoors
          there, keeping the shop close to the same neighbors, hunters, and
          families who had always depended on it.

          Still here for the next season
        </h2>
        <p class="mb-6 leading-relaxed">
          Today, WV Wild Outdoors continues in that newer corner-lot location
          as a straightforward, local shop run by people who know the area they
          serve. Whether it’s getting sighted in for buck season, stocking up on
          feed, or grabbing gear before a weekend in the woods, the goal is the
          same: make it easy for locals to get what they need without leaving
          the hills and hollows they call home.
