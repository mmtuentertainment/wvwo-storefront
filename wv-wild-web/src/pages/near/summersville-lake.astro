  {
    title: 'White-tailed Deer',
    description: 'The mature hardwoods and mixed forest provide good deer habitat. Buck firearms season runs November through December. Archery opens in late September.',
    notes: 'The ridges overlooking the lake hold deer year-round. Creek bottoms and oak flats are good for feeding areas. The terrain is steep in places — be prepared for a climb.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Wild Turkey',
    description: 'Spring gobbler season brings birds working the ridges at dawn. The mature hardwoods make turkey hunting particularly good here. Fall turkey season is also available.',
    notes: 'Ridge tops in mature timber for roosting birds. Listen for gobbles at dawn and set up between the roost and where they want to go. Don\'t overcall — let them come to you.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Black Bear',
    description: 'Nicholas County is in West Virginia\'s bear zone. Multiple seasons run mid-September through December. Bear Damage Stamp required in addition to hunting license.',
    notes: 'Check WV DNR bear regulations for current season dates and zone rules. The thick cover and oak mast make this good bear habitat.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Grouse & Squirrel',
    description: 'Ruffed grouse in the younger timber and regenerating cuts. Squirrel hunting is excellent in the mature hardwoods — all that oak and hickory produces good mast.',

// Fishing species data
const fishingFeatures: FishingFeature[] = [
  {
    title: 'Smallmouth Bass',
    description: 'Summersville is smallmouth country. The clear, deep water and rocky structure make this lake one of the premier smallmouth fisheries in the state. Fish regularly run 14-18 inches, with bigger ones mixed in.',
    notes: 'The water\'s gin-clear, so downsize your line to 6-8 lb test and go with natural colors. Tube jigs and drop shot rigs with soft plastics work well. Target rocky points and ledges — the smallmouth stack up on structure.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Largemouth Bass',
    description: 'Don\'t overlook the largemouth. They hold around cover near the bank and in the backs of coves. Work shallow cover with spinnerbaits and soft plastics.',
    notes: 'The clear water means bass can see you coming, so keep your distance and make long casts. Early morning and late evening are best windows.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Walleye',
    description: 'Walleye are present throughout the lake and follow baitfish around points and ledges. Special regulations apply: all walleye from 20 to 30 inches long must be returned immediately. Daily creel limit is eight walleye, only one of which may be over 30 inches.',
    notes: 'Troll crankbaits along points or jig with live bait near the dam. Low-light periods — dawn, dusk, and overcast days — are your best bet. Night fishing is permitted.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Muskie',
    description: 'Muskie are present and can run 40+ inches. These fish are the apex predators in the lake and require heavy tackle.',
    notes: 'Muskie here can run 40+ inches — bring heavy tackle. Large bucktails, jerkbaits, and topwater lures work well. Fish the points and deep ledges near the dam. Be patient — muskie fishing is called the fish of 10,000 casts for a reason.'
  },
  {
    title: 'Crappie & Panfish',
    description: 'Crappie, bluegill, and yellow perch round out the options. The lake holds the state record for yellow perch. Spring is prime time for crappie spawning in the shallows.',
    notes: 'Crappie and panfish hold around submerged structure and brush piles. Use small jigs and live minnows.'

            Long Point Cliff is the signature dive site — a towering rock formation that plunges
            40+ feet underwater. The Overlook site offers more diversity with fish viewing,
            a ledge at 52 feet, tree stumps, and boulders. There's even a small boat that
            was intentionally sunk for divers to explore.
