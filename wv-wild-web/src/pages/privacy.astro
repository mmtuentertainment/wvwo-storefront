            In-Store Purchases
          </h2>
          <p class="text-stone-600 mb-4">
            For in-store firearm purchases, we are required by federal law to collect
            certain information for ATF Form 4473 and conduct NICS background checks.
            This information is:

            <li>Collected only at time of purchase in our physical store</li>
            <li>Required by federal law for firearm transactions</li>

            Cookies and Tracking
          </h2>
          <p class="text-stone-600 mb-4">
            Our website uses minimal tracking. We use Cloudflare Analytics, which is
            privacy-focused and does not use cookies to track individual visitors.
          </p>

          <h2 class="font-display font-bold text-xl text-brand-brown mt-8 mb-4">
            Do Not Track Signals
          </h2>
          <p class="text-stone-600 mb-4">
            Some web browsers have a "Do Not Track" feature that lets you tell websites
            you don't want your online activities tracked. Our website does not respond
            to Do Not Track signals. That said, we use Cloudflare Analytics which doesn't
            track individual visitors anyway—it just shows us overall traffic patterns
            without identifying anyone.
