            Under federal law (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922" class="text-brand-orange hover:underline">18 U.S.C. § 922(g)</a>),
            certain individuals are prohibited from purchasing or possessing firearms. You cannot
            buy a firearm from WV Wild Outdoors if you:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-stone-600 mb-6 space-y-2">

            Straw Purchases Are Illegal
          </h2>
          <p class="text-stone-600 mb-4">
            A "straw purchase" is when you buy a firearm for someone else who cannot
            legally purchase it themselves. This includes buying a gun for a prohibited
            person, a minor, or anyone who cannot pass a background check.
          </p>
          <p class="text-stone-600 mb-4">
            <strong>Straw purchases are a federal crime</strong> under
            <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922" class="text-brand-orange hover:underline">18 U.S.C. § 922(a)(6)</a>
            and can result in up to 10 years in prison and a $250,000 fine.
          </p>
          <p class="text-stone-600 mb-4">
            When you fill out ATF Form 4473, you are certifying that <strong>you are
            the actual buyer</strong> of the firearm. If you're buying a gun as a gift
            for someone who can legally own it, that's okay—but they still need to be
            eligible to possess firearms.
          </p>

            To purchase a firearm at WV Wild Outdoors, you'll need:
          </p>
          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-stone-600 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Valid government-issued photo ID</strong> with your current address (driver's license, state ID, or passport with proof of address)</li>
            <li>Ability to complete <a href="https://www.atf.gov/firearms/firearms-forms" class="text-brand-orange hover:underline">ATF Form 4473</a> in person</li>

          <ul class="list-disc pl-6 text-stone-600 mb-6 space-y-2">
            <li><strong>Handguns:</strong> Federal law (<a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/922" class="text-brand-orange hover:underline">18 U.S.C. § 922(b)(3)</a>) does not allow us to transfer handguns to out-of-state residents.

            Returns & Refunds - Firearms
          </h2>
          <p class="text-stone-600 mb-4">
            All firearm sales at WV Wild Outdoors are final once the transfer is complete.
            Once you take possession of a firearm after completing ATF Form 4473 and passing
            the NICS background check, the sale cannot be reversed.
          </p>
          <p class="text-stone-600 mb-4">
            <strong>Please inspect your firearm before we start the paperwork.</strong>
            Check the action, bore, finish, and overall condition. Once you sign Form 4473
            and take possession, the sale is final. We want you to be completely satisfied,
            so take your time looking it over first.
          </p>
          <p class="text-stone-600 mb-4">
            If you change your mind before the transfer is complete, please let us know.
            Background check fees are non-refundable once the NICS check is initiated.
