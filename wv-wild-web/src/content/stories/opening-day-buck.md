# Opening Day Buck

*Shared with permission from one of our regulars*

Mike came in the night before opening day - needed some scent killer and a new release. We got to talking about where he was hunting, and he mentioned a spot up on Elk River WMA where he'd been seeing sign all season.

## The Hunt

He set up before first light in a saddle between two ridges. About 7:30, this 10-pointer came through following a doe. One shot, 40 yards.

## The Gear

- Mathews VXR (bought here two seasons ago)
- Rage broadheads
- Code Blue doe estrus

Congrats, Mike. That's what it's all about.
