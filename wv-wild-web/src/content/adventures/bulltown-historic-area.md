## About Bulltown Historic Area

Bulltown Historic Area isn't a single museum or monument - it's a landscape that tells the long story of Appalachia. From the Indigenous peoples who named the Elk River for its abundant game, through Civil War division, industrial devastation, and conservation recovery, these hills hold layers of history.

## Indigenous Heritage

The Shawnee, Delaware, and Mingo peoples hunted these forests for millennia. Their name for the Elk River - "the river of plenty fat elk" - speaks to the abundance they maintained through careful land management. The Treaty of Camp Charlotte (1774) began their displacement from ancestral lands.

## The Logging Era

Walk the WMA trails today and you're walking through recovery. From 1880 to 1930, industrial logging stripped the forests bare. Palmer Lumber and Pardee & Curtin Lumber removed an estimated 30 billion board feet of timber. The pristine old-growth was gone.

What you see today - mature oaks, hickories, and mixed hardwoods - is second-growth forest, roughly 80-120 years old. Testament to the land's resilience.

## Conservation Recovery

The conservation story begins in 1923 with Seneca State Forest game refuge and continues through 1938 Holly River designation to the 1989 Wildlife Management Area redesignation. Today, Elk River WMA protects nearly 19,000 acres of recovering forest.

## Elk Return

The most remarkable chapter is still being written. West Virginia's elk restoration program, launched in 2015, is bringing back the animal that gave the river its name. After 150 years, elk once again roam these Appalachian forests.
