# Summersville Lake WMA - The Little Bahamas of the East

They call it the Little Bahamas of the East for good reason. At 2,790 acres, Summersville is West Virginia's largest lake, and Skin Diver Magazine called it the cleanest, clearest freshwater lake east of the Mississippi. On a good day, you can see 30-45 feet down.

But Summersville isn't just for divers and swimmers. The lake produces some of the best smallmouth bass fishing in West Virginia. The surrounding 5,974-acre Wildlife Management Area provides hunting for deer, turkey, and bear in mature hardwood forests and steep ridges.

## What to Fish

### Smallmouth Bass
Summersville is smallmouth country. The clear, deep water and rocky structure make this lake one of the premier smallmouth fisheries in the state. Fish regularly run 14-18 inches, with bigger ones mixed in.

**Kim's tip:** The water's gin-clear, so downsize your line to 6-8 lb test and go with natural colors. Tube jigs and drop shot rigs with soft plastics work well. Target rocky points and ledges — the smallmouth stack up on structure.

### Muskie
Muskie are present and can run 40+ inches. These fish are the apex predators in the lake and require heavy tackle.

**Kim's tip:** Muskie here can run 40+ inches — bring heavy tackle. Large bucktails, jerkbaits, and topwater lures work well. Fish the points and deep ledges near the dam. Be patient — muskie fishing is called the fish of 10,000 casts for a reason.

### Walleye & Other Species
Walleye, largemouth bass, crappie, bluegill, and catfish round out the options. Special regulations apply to walleye: all fish from 20 to 30 inches must be returned immediately.

## What to Hunt

The Summersville Lake WMA covers nearly 6,000 acres of tableland forests and towering cliffs overlooking the lake. Game includes deer, turkey, bear, grouse, and squirrel.

### White-tailed Deer
The mature hardwoods and mixed forest provide good deer habitat. Buck firearms season runs November through December. Archery opens in late September.

**Kim's tip:** The ridges overlooking the lake hold deer year-round. Creek bottoms and oak flats are good for feeding areas. The terrain is steep in places — be prepared for a climb.

### Wild Turkey
Spring gobbler season brings birds working the ridges at dawn. The mature hardwoods make turkey hunting particularly good here.

**Kim's tip:** Ridge tops in mature timber for roosting birds. Listen for gobbles at dawn and set up between the roost and where they want to go. Don't overcall — let them come to you.

## Crystal Clear Waters

Skin Diver Magazine called it the cleanest, clearest freshwater lake east of the Mississippi. Visibility can reach 30-45 feet. Long Point Cliff is the signature dive site — a towering rock formation that plunges 40+ feet underwater.

Battle Run Beach offers swimming access. Multiple boat ramps throughout the lake provide easy water access.

## Facilities

Battle Run Campground sits on a peninsula with water on three sides. 110 electric hookup sites plus 7 walk-in tent sites. Multiple private campgrounds nearby. Summersville Lake Marina offers kayak and pontoon rentals. Sarge's Dive Shop provides scuba gear and certification.

## Getting There

From our shop on US-19 in Birch River:
1. Head south on US-19 through Summersville (about 40 miles)
2. Turn right on WV-129 toward the lake
3. Follow signs to Battle Run or your destination
4. About 30 minutes total drive time

Stop by the shop before you head out. We'll get you set up with licenses, tackle, bait, and local tips on what's been biting.

## Kim's Take

"Summersville is special. The water clarity is unmatched in West Virginia — feels like you're fishing in the Bahamas. The smallmouth here are some of the best in the state. Don't be intimidated by the clear water — just downsize your tackle and fish natural colors. And if you're after muskie, bring heavy gear. These fish can run 40+ inches and will test your equipment."
