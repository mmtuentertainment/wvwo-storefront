# Summersville Lake - The Little Bahamas of the East

They call it the Little Bahamas of the East for good reason. At 2,790 acres, Summersville is West Virginia's largest lake with exceptional water clarity — visibility regularly reaches 20-45 feet. The oligotrophic (low-nutrient) water stays remarkably clear year-round.

The crystal-clear water comes from the sandstone geology of the flooded Gauley River gorge - the same geology that creates dramatic underwater cliffs for scuba diving.

## What to Fish

### Smallmouth Bass

Summersville is smallmouth country. The clear, deep water and rocky structure make this lake one of the premier smallmouth fisheries in the state. Fish regularly run 14-18 inches, with bigger ones mixed in.

**Kim's tip:** The water's gin-clear, so downsize your line to 6-8 lb test and go with natural colors. Tube jigs and drop shot rigs with soft plastics work well. Target rocky points and ledges — the smallmouth stack up on structure.

### Muskie

Muskie are present and can run 40+ inches. These fish are the apex predators in the lake and require heavy tackle.

**Kim's tip:** Muskie here can run 40+ inches — bring heavy tackle. Large bucktails, jerkbaits, and topwater lures work well. Fish the points and deep ledges near the dam. Be patient — muskie fishing is called the fish of 10,000 casts for a reason.

### Walleye & Other Species

Walleye, largemouth bass, crappie, bluegill, and catfish round out the options. Special regulations apply to walleye: all fish from 20 to 30 inches must be returned immediately.

**Note:** Mercury advisory (Jan 2025) - limit walleye and flathead catfish consumption to 2 meals per month.

## Crystal Clear Waters

The lake's exceptional clarity — visibility regularly reaches 20-45 feet — makes it a premier freshwater diving destination in the eastern United States. Long Point is the signature dive site, where dramatic sandstone walls descend approximately 100 feet underwater.

### Scuba Diving

Certified divers can explore year-round through Sarge's Dive Shop at Long Point Marina. The underwater landscape includes:
- Long Point Cliff - dramatic walls descending 100+ feet
- The Wall - sheer sandstone cliffs
- Submerged Town of Gad - ghost town flooded in 1966

### Swimming

Battle Run Beach offers a 1,000-foot swimming beach with crystal-clear water. No lifeguards - swim at your own risk. $5 day use fee.

**IMPORTANT:** Cliff jumping has been prohibited since 2007. Citations are issued.

## Facilities

- **Battle Run Campground** - 117 sites on a peninsula (PETS PROHIBITED)
- **Summersville Lake Marina** - 473 slips, kayak and pontoon rentals
- **Sarge's Dive Shop** - Scuba gear, certification, and charter trips
- **Multiple Boat Ramps** - Easy water access throughout the lake

- **[Submerged Town of Gad](/historic/gad/)** - Ghost town beneath the lake (scuba or drawdown access)

## Getting There

From our shop on US-19 in Birch River:
1. Head south on US-19 through Summersville (about 40 miles)
2. Turn right on WV-129 toward the lake
3. Follow signs to Battle Run or your destination
4. About 30 minutes total drive time

Stop by the shop before you head out. We'll get you set up with licenses, tackle, bait, and local tips on what's been biting.

## Kim's Take

"Summersville is special. The water clarity is unmatched in West Virginia — feels like you're fishing in the Bahamas. The smallmouth here are some of the best in the state. Don't be intimidated by the clear water — just downsize your tackle and fish natural colors. And if you're after muskie, bring heavy gear. These fish can run 40+ inches and will test your equipment."
