## The Drowned Town

The town of Gad stood along the Gauley River for over 150 years before progress swallowed it whole. When Summersville Dam closed its gates in 1966, the rising waters consumed homes, roads, and the post office that had served this community since 1860.

Today, Gad lies beneath up to 327 feet of crystal-clear water - the same water that earned Summersville Lake its nickname as the "Little Bahamas of the East."

## What Remains

Stone foundations, old roadways, and rock carvings made by long-gone residents rest on the lake bottom. The Thomas Patrick, a small boat intentionally sunk in the 1990s for diver interest, sits at about 30 feet near the dam.

During major maintenance drawdowns - roughly every 10 years - the lake drops 55+ feet below normal summer pool, revealing Gad's remnants to anyone willing to walk the muddy exposed lakebed. The 2024-2025 drawdown brought Gad to the surface once again.

## Exploring the Ghost Town

### Scuba Diving (Primary Access)

Certified divers can explore Gad year-round through charter services from Sarge's Dive Shop at Long Point Marina. Summer visibility averages 20-45 feet - exceptional for freshwater diving anywhere in the eastern United States.

### Drawdown Events (Rare)

When USACE conducts major drawdowns, the ghost town becomes accessible by foot. These events happen approximately once per decade. Check USACE Huntington District announcements.

### Surface Viewing

On calm, sunny days, the exceptional water clarity allows viewing features 20-30+ feet down from kayaks, paddleboards, or boats.

## The Story of Progress

President Lyndon B. Johnson dedicated Summersville Dam on September 3, 1966, celebrating flood control for the Kanawha Valley. The $48 million project created West Virginia's largest lake - and drowned communities that had existed for generations.

What was lost beneath the surface became legend. What emerged was something unexpected: waters so clear they rival tropical destinations, drawing divers from across the eastern United States to explore what remains of Gad.
