# Backcountry Hunting at Cranberry Wilderness

Cranberry Wilderness isn't your typical hunting spot. This is real backcountry - 47,815 acres of wilderness area where you're on your own. Pack extra food, bring a good first aid kit, and tell someone where you're going.

## What to Expect

The Cranberry Wilderness sits at high elevation with steep ridges, native brook trout streams, and miles of forest. This is designated wilderness - no vehicles, no ATVs, just foot travel. Black bear, deer, and turkey are here, but they're wild and wary.

## When to Go

- **Peak Season**: Fall archery (September-October), buck firearms (November-December)
- **Spring Turkey**: April-May for gobblers
- **Best Time**: Early morning. Plan to hike in the day before and camp.

## What to Bring

This is backcountry. Bring everything you'd need to spend a night in the woods even if you're planning a day hunt. Weather changes fast at this elevation.

## Kim's Take

"This is backcountry - pack extra food, first aid. Native brook trout in the headwaters if you want to fish while you're out there. Don't go alone."
