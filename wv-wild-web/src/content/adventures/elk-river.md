## About Elk River

The Elk River flows through the heart of West Virginia, supporting over 100 fish species and 30 mussel species - making it one of the most ecologically diverse rivers in the state. From trophy trout in the cold tailwaters below Sutton Dam to warm-water bass and muskie in Sutton Lake, plus easy paddling through scenic Appalachian forests.

## Fishing

The Elk River offers exceptional fishing diversity:

**Cold-water (Tailwaters):** Brown Trout, Rainbow Trout, Golden Rainbow Trout, Brook Trout, Tiger Trout

**Warm-water (Sutton Lake):** Largemouth Bass, Smallmouth Bass, Spotted Bass, Muskellunge, Walleye, Bluegill, Channel Catfish, Crappie

## Paddling

With Class I-II rapids, the Elk River is perfect for beginners and families. The tailwater run below Sutton Dam offers easy floating through scenic forest, while the Rail Trail section provides gentle riffles with convenient access points.

## Conservation Note

The Elk River is home to two of the rarest fish in North America:
- **Crystal darter** (Crystallaria asprella) - EXTREMELY RARE, only 8 specimens ever found
- **Diamond darter** (Etheostoma mooneyi) - found ONLY in Elk River worldwide

Handle all darters carefully and report unusual catches to WVDNR.
