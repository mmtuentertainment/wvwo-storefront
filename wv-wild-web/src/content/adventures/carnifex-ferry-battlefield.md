## About Carnifex Ferry Battlefield

Carnifex Ferry Battlefield State Park preserves the site of one of the most significant early Civil War battles in western Virginia. On September 10, 1861, Union forces commanded by Brigadier General William Rosecrans attacked Confederate troops under Brigadier General John B. Floyd at the Patterson Farm, overlooking the Gauley River.

The Union victory helped secure the strategic Kanawha Valley and demonstrated that western Virginia would remain loyal to the Union - a crucial step toward West Virginia's eventual statehood in 1863.

## What to See

The park features the original Patterson House, which served as Confederate headquarters during the battle. The Civil War Museum houses artifacts from the engagement, including weapons, uniforms, and personal effects of the soldiers who fought here.

Walking trails lead through preserved Confederate earthworks, offering visitors a tangible connection to the defensive positions that Floyd's troops hastily constructed. The park's scenic overlooks provide stunning views of the Gauley River gorge.

## Annual Events

The highlight of the park calendar is the Battle Anniversary Reenactment, held the weekend nearest September 10th. Hundreds of reenactors recreate camp life, military drills, and the battle itself, making history come alive for visitors of all ages.
