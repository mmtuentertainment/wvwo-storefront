# Burnsville Lake WMA - 12,579 Acres of Central WV Hunting

Burnsville Lake Wildlife Management Area wraps around a 968-acre Corps of Engineers lake in the heart of Braxton County. Twelve thousand five hundred seventy-nine acres of old farm fields growing into young forest, mature hardwood ridges, and Little Kanawha River bottomlands. The kind of terrain that holds deer, turkeys, grouse, and small game year-round.

25 minutes from our shop and you are on public land. The terrain is forgiving compared to some WV WMAs - gentle uplands, mowed field edges, old logging roads you can actually walk. Good for hunters of any age or ability level. Class Q access means disabled hunters can get to spots others walk past.

## What to Hunt

### White-Tailed Deer

The 14-inch antler spread rule has done what it was supposed to do. Bucks are getting older. The 12,579 acres give you room to spread out and hunt smart.

**Where to hunt:** Old farm fields grown into early successional forest make prime habitat. Bucks bed in the thick young growth during rifle season and move to field edges at dawn and dusk. The ridge saddles between hollows are travel corridors worth sitting.

**When to hunt:** Rut peaks November 10-18 in Braxton County. Bucks cruise the mid-slope benches and ridge saddles all day during peak rut. Cold fronts in late October kick off pre-rut movement.

**Kim's tip:** Those gentle uplands along the river make for good glassing. Fog holds in the bottomlands until 8-9 AM in November - set up on ridges where it clears first. South-facing slopes warm faster. Southwest to west winds prevail, so approach from the east when you can.

### Wild Turkey

Spring gobblers love the bottomlands near the Little Kanawha River. They roost in the big timber along the water and fly down to feed in the old fields. Set up before daybreak and listen - they sound off good in that river valley.

**Where to hunt:** Look for benched ridges 100-200 feet below the ridge crests for roosts. Turkeys prefer to roost on slopes overlooking water. The old farm fields and forest openings are feeding and strutting areas.

**Calling strategy:** Ridge-to-ridge calling works here. Position on the same contour elevation and call aggressively to pull birds across the drainage. In the thick bottomland vegetation, back off to soft yelps and purrs.

**Kim's tip:** April 20 opens spring season. Youth season April 18-19. Set up within 150-200 yards of a marked roost on the same contour. Owl hoot at first light to get them fired up. Don't overcall - let them come to you. Fall hunting is decent, but spring is when they really talk.

### Ruffed Grouse

Young forest equals grouse. This WMA has it. Population is down 30-70% across Appalachia since 2002, but there are still birds here if you work for them.

**Where to hunt:** Target regenerating timber cuts 5-15 years old with dense stems. Trail edges with young growth. Recent disturbance areas - windthrow, ice storm damage, selective harvest sites.

**When to hunt:** January and February are historically the best months for grouse in the Apps. Hunt mid-week to avoid what little pressure there is.

**Kim's tip:** Walk the logging roads slow and work those thick edges. They flush hard and fast. Keep your safety off once you hit the brush. Bring water for the dog - no reliable water sources mapped in the interior.

### Small Game

**Squirrels** are in the oak-hickory ridges. Daily limit 6. Youth season September 6-7 gets kids into the woods early. October mornings on the ridge tops are as good as it gets.

**Rabbits** work the field edges and briar patches. Daily limit 5. Good for training young beagles or taking kids out.

**Kim's tip:** Field edges for rabbits, hardwoods for squirrels. Both are thick here. Squirrel hunting the ridge tops in October is a good warm-up for deer season.

## Access Points and Terrain

### Bulltown Area (Upstream/North)

From I-79 Exit 67, take Route 19 North about 13 miles. This is the gentler side of the WMA with bottomlands, old farm fields, and the Civil War battlefield. Confederate Overlook gives you a parking area and trail access to the uplands.

Bulltown Campground has 133+ sites with full hookups if you want to make a weekend of it. The historic area is worth a look - Union soldiers held off 800 Confederates here in October 1863.

### Riffle Run Area (Downstream/Dam)

From I-79 Exit 79, take Old Route 5 East about 3 miles. Steeper terrain here with mature hardwoods and river corridor access. Riffle Run Campground has 60 sites, 54 with full hookups. First-come, first-served only - no reservations.

### Interior Access

The WMA has 57+ miles of designated trails including:
- **Falls Mill Trail** (2.17 miles)
- **Flag Knob Trail** (3.55 miles)
- **Indian Ridge Trail** (1.77 miles)
- **Baker Trail** (2.46 miles)
- **Weston-Gauley Bridge Turnpike** (4.8 miles - historic route)

WMA boundaries are marked with blue paint and metal signs. If you hit unmarked ground, you may have crossed into private inholdings.

### Cell Coverage Reality

**There is none.** Verizon might work at the campgrounds and dam area. Nothing in the interior. Download offline maps before you leave the shop. Carry a paper map and compass. If you hunt solo, consider a satellite communicator.

Bulltown Campground has WiFi now - useful for electronic game check after the hunt.

## Class Q Access for Disabled Hunters

Burnsville Lake is one of 14 WV WMAs with Class Q hunting access. This means expanded vehicle access behind normally locked gates for hunters with qualifying disabilities.

**How to apply:** Contact WVDNR District 3 Office at (304) 924-6211. Submit application demonstrating qualifying disability. If approved, you can drive gated roads others can't access.

The gentle upland terrain and old farm field edges make this WMA more accessible than most, even without Class Q status.

## Regulations You Need to Know

- **Electronic game check required** within 24 hours. Use WVhunt.com or call 1-844-WVCHECK.
- **Blaze orange** - 400+ square inches during firearms deer season.
- **Portable stands only** - must be non-bark penetrating and removed after each hunt.
- **No target shooting** on WMA land. Sight in at home before you come.

4. Follow signs to your destination

**Total drive time:** 25 minutes from the shop.

## Kim's Take

"This WMA is managed by WV DNR and the Army Corps of Engineers together. It wraps around Burnsville Lake - you get 12,579 acres of huntable land and a 968-acre lake with world-class fishing.

The terrain is gentle uplands and old farm fields grown into young forest. That is prime habitat. Deer bed in the thick stuff and feed in the fields. Turkeys roost along the Little Kanawha and work the bottomlands. Grouse numbers are better here than a lot of places if you walk slow and work the edges.

The 14-inch antler spread rule is doing its job. I am seeing more mature deer in the county. The rut peaks November 10-18 - that is when you want to be in a tree.

Cell coverage is non-existent in the interior, so plan accordingly. Download your maps before you leave, tell someone where you are going, and carry what you need to get out if something goes wrong.

The whole area is set up for disabled hunters. Class Q accommodations, wheelchair ramps at the facilities, gentle terrain you can actually hunt. That is something you do not see everywhere.

You can hunt hard here and not see another soul. That is worth the 25-minute drive."
