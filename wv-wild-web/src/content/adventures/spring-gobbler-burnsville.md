# Spring Gobbler Season at Burnsville Lake WMA

Turkey season at Burnsville is something special. The birds here roost along the ridges overlooking the lake, and on a quiet morning, you can hear them gobbling from across the hollow.

## What to Expect

The WMA covers over 12,000 acres of mixed hardwoods and open fields. Best spots are along the upper ridges where the oaks give way to clearings - turkeys love to strut there in the early morning.

## When to Go

- **Peak Season**: Mid-April through early May
- **Best Time**: First light. Be set up before sunrise.

## What to Bring

Stop by the shop before you head out - we'll make sure you've got your Class Q license and can recommend calls based on what's been working this season.

## Kim's Take

"I've hunted this WMA since I was a kid. The birds here aren't call-shy like some places - they'll come to a good box call. Just don't overcall. Let 'em come to you."
