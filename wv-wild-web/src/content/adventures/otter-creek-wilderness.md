Otter Creek Wilderness is 20,000 acres of uninterrupted Appalachian forest in Randolph County - one of West Virginia's most remote and challenging wilderness areas. This is old-growth wilderness where white-tailed deer outnumber hikers, where the trail system requires real navigation skills, and where you can hike all day without seeing another soul.

Named for the river otters that once populated the main creek, this wilderness sits in a valley carved between McGowan Mountain and Shavers Mountain. Elevations range from 2,200 feet along Otter Creek to over 3,800 feet on the surrounding ridges. The terrain is characterized by dense mixed hardwood and hemlock forests, mountain laurel thickets, and rocky stream valleys.

Unlike the heath barrens of Dolly Sods, Otter Creek offers classic Appalachian wilderness - the kind that challenges you with steep climbs, difficult stream crossings, and navigation that requires constant attention to your map. The trail system is extensive but lightly maintained. Blazes fade, blowdowns are common, and in places the path becomes more of a suggestion than a defined route.

## Water Quality Concerns

Like Dolly Sods, Otter Creek Wilderness has water contamination issues from historic mining. Coal Run, one of the major tributaries, carries Acid Mine Drainage that gives the water an orange tint and makes it unsafe for consumption regardless of your filtration method. The heavy metals and low pH cannot be removed by backcountry treatment.

The main stem of Otter Creek itself is generally clear and safe to treat, as are most of the smaller tributary streams. Always verify water color before collecting. If it's orange, rust-colored, or has iron deposits on the rocks, find a different source. Plan your water carries accordingly and know your sources before you commit to a route.

## Stream Crossings Are Required

There's no way around it - hiking Otter Creek means getting your feet wet. The main trail along Otter Creek crosses the stream repeatedly, and after heavy rain these crossings can be knee-deep or higher. Spring snowmelt and summer thunderstorms can raise water levels quickly.

Bring waterproof boots or plan to hike wet. Trekking poles are essential for stability on slick rocks. Cross streams early in the day before afternoon storms, and never attempt a crossing if the water is brown and high. Flash floods are rare but possible in this terrain.

## Navigation Requirements

Cell service is weak to nonexistent throughout most of the wilderness. You might catch a signal on the higher ridges, but don't count on it. A satellite communicator is strongly recommended for emergency communication.

The trail blazing is inconsistent - yellow diamonds on some trails, orange on others, and faded or missing in sections. Carry the USGS topographic quads for Parsons and Bowden at minimum. Know how to orient your map with a compass and take regular bearings. Download offline maps before you lose signal.

Trail intersections are marked but not always obvious. Pay attention to your mileage and don't rely solely on GPS. Battery life becomes critical when you're navigating by device in the backcountry.

## When to Go

Late spring through early summer (May-June) offers excellent conditions. Water levels are manageable, the rhododendrons bloom along the creek, and the forest canopy provides shade without the oppressive humidity of mid-summer. This is prime tick season though - do your checks religiously.

Fall (late September-October) brings stunning color and cooler temperatures. The stream crossings are easier with lower water levels. Hunting season opens in October, so wear blaze orange and be aware of your surroundings.

Winter transforms Otter Creek into expert-only terrain. Snow can make stream crossings treacherous, and the access roads may not be maintained. Only experienced winter backpackers should attempt this area from December through March.

## Wildlife and Solitude

Black bears are common here - more so than in Dolly Sods due to the dense forest cover. Practice good food storage, keep a clean camp, and make noise while hiking. Deer, turkey, and grouse are abundant. You might see evidence of bobcat or coyote but rarely the animals themselves.

The real reward of Otter Creek is the solitude. Even on summer weekends, you can hike for hours without encountering another person. This is wilderness in the truest sense - remote, challenging, and largely left to its own devices.

Come prepared with solid backcountry skills, respect the terrain, and you'll find some of the best wilderness hiking West Virginia has to offer. This isn't a place to learn - but if you've got your navigation and camping dialed in, Otter Creek will become one of your favorite escapes.
