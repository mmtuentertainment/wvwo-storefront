# Holly River WMA - Steep Hollows & Mountain Bears

This is mountain country. At 8,286 acres, Holly River WMA sits in the heart of Webster County where the hollows run steep and the ridges top out over 2,800 feet. The Left Fork of Holly River cuts through the valley, and the surrounding mountains hold deer, black bear, turkey, grouse, and rabbit.

This isn't easy terrain. The slopes are steep, the timber is thick, and you'll earn every step. But if you want a real mountain hunt away from the crowds, Holly River delivers.

## What to Hunt

### White-tailed Deer
The mature hardwood forests and mixed timber provide solid deer habitat. Oak and hickory mast in the hollows, bedding cover on the ridges, and creek bottoms for travel corridors. The steep terrain means deer move between feeding and bedding areas on predictable routes.

**Kim's tip:** The hollows hold deer during the day, especially in pressure situations. Set up where ridges funnel down to creek crossings. Good boots are non-negotiable — the terrain will test you. Scout before season and mark your entry and exit routes. GPS or topo map required.

### Black Bear
Webster County is prime bear country. Holly River WMA sits in the heart of the bear zone with multiple seasons running mid-September through December. The thick cover, oak mast, and remote hollows make this excellent bear habitat.

**Kim's tip:** Bears are active September through November — oak acorns bring them down from the high country. Check WV DNR bear regulations for current season dates and zone rules. Bear Damage Stamp required in addition to hunting license. These bears are wild and wary. Hunt over bait (where legal) or still-hunt ridges during mast years.

### Wild Turkey
Spring gobbler season brings birds working the ridges at dawn. The mature hardwoods make turkey hunting particularly good here. Fall turkey season is also available.

**Kim's tip:** Ridge tops in mature timber for roosting birds. Listen for gobbles at first light and set up between the roost and where they want to go. The hollows carry sound — you can hear birds a long way off. Don't overcall. Let them come to you.

### Ruffed Grouse
Grouse hold in the younger timber and regenerating cuts along the ridges. The birds flush hard and fast in thick cover. Good grouse numbers in the right habitat.

**Kim's tip:** Work the edges where mature forest meets younger growth. Early morning and late afternoon are best. These birds sit tight until you're on top of them, then explode out of the brush. Be ready for fast shooting.

### Rabbit & Squirrel
Rabbits in the brush piles and brambles along creek bottoms. Squirrels in the mature oak and hickory stands. Both provide good small game hunting throughout the season.

**Kim's tip:** Squirrel hunting is excellent in the mature hardwoods — all that oak and hickory produces good mast. Hunt mornings when they're feeding. For rabbits, work the creek bottoms and brush piles after a light snow.

## What to Fish

### Trout in Holly River
The Left Fork of Holly River is stocked with rainbow and brook trout. The WV DNR stocks once in February and once every two weeks in March, April, and May. Small stream fishing with native brookies in the headwater tributaries.

**Kim's tip:** The river gets stocked regularly during spring, but you're fishing small mountain water. Ultra-light tackle, 4-6 lb test, and small spinners or flies. The native brookies in the headwaters are wild and spooky — use stealth and light line. Check WVdnr.gov/fish-stocking for current stocking updates. Trout stamp required.

## Facilities

### Primitive Camping
Primitive camping is permitted on the WMA. No developed sites, no hookups. Pack in, pack out. This is backcountry camping.

**Kim's tip:** Come prepared for primitive conditions. Water from streams needs treatment. The terrain is steep, so camp near water sources if you can find flat ground. No facilities on site.

### Hiking Trails
Over 42 miles of hiking trails wind through the area. Trails to two waterfalls — Tecumseh Falls and Tenskwatawa Falls — are popular destinations. Potato Knob offers commanding views at 2,480 feet. Ridge Road Trail and Rock Camp Trail are designated horse trails.

**Kim's tip:** The trails are steep and rugged. Good boots, water, and a map are required. The waterfall trails are worth the hike, but don't underestimate the elevation gain.

### Holly River State Park (Adjacent)
The 8,101-acre state park sits adjacent to the WMA and offers developed facilities including ten furnished cabins with stone fireplaces, an 88-site campground with electric hookups, seasonal swimming pool, and restaurant. Cabins 1-9 are available April through November; Cabin 10 is year-round.

**Kim's tip:** If you want a base camp with facilities, stay at the state park and hunt or fish the WMA. The park campground has showers, flush toilets, and laundry. Reserve early for peak season.

## Getting There

From our shop on US-19 in Birch River:
1. Head north on US-19 toward Summersville
2. Turn right on US-19/WV-4 toward Webster Springs
3. Follow WV-20 north to Hacker Valley
4. Follow signs to Holly River State Park
5. About 35 minutes total drive time

Stop by the shop before you head out. We'll get you set up with licenses, bear stamps, and local tips.

## When to Go

- **Deer Hunting:** Archery opens late September, firearms November-December
- **Bear Hunting:** Multiple seasons mid-September through December (check DNR regulations)
- **Turkey Hunting:** Spring gobbler mid-April through May, fall season available
- **Grouse & Small Game:** Fall through winter
- **Trout Fishing:** Stocked February-May, native brookies year-round (best spring and fall)

## Kim's Take

"Holly River is steep country — no way around it. The hollows are deep, the ridges are high, and you'll feel it in your legs by the end of the day. But that's what keeps the pressure down. Good boots aren't optional here — they're required.

The bears are active September through November when the acorns start falling. If you're serious about bear hunting, this is the real deal. Bear Damage Stamp required, and check the zone regulations before you go.

For trout, the river gets stocked regularly in spring, but the native brookies in the headwaters are the prize. Small water, small fish, but they're wild and beautiful. Ultra-light tackle only.

Stop by the shop. We'll get you set up with what you need and point you in the right direction. This isn't beginner country, but if you're ready for a mountain hunt, Holly River won't disappoint."
