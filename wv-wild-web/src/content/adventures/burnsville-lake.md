# Burnsville Lake - State Record Muskie Waters

Burnsville Lake is where West Virginia's state-record muskie came from. 51 pounds, 55.06 inches. Lucas King pulled it from the tailwater in March 2022 on a 6-inch glide bait cast from shore. That fish put this 968-acre Corps of Engineers lake on the map.

But Burnsville was producing long before that record. Crappie anglers have been filling coolers here for decades - 40 to 60 fish evenings around the brush piles. Walleye run quality sizes under a special 15-inch minimum that protects younger fish. Channel and flathead catfish grow fat in the deep channel bends.

25 minutes from our shop. Three boat ramps. A marina with pontoon rentals. 200+ campsites if you want to make a weekend of it. And less fishing pressure than the lake deserves because most folks drive past to get somewhere else.

## The State Record Fishery

### Muskellunge

Burnsville Lake and its tailwater have produced three state records since 2017:

- **March 2022:** Lucas King - **51.00 lbs, 55.0625 inches** (Little Kanawha River tailwater). Current state records for both weight and length.
- **April 2021:** Chase Gibson - 39.64 lbs, 54.0625 inches (Burnsville Lake proper)
- **2017:** Previous length record at 53.5 inches

WV DNR actively stocks muskellunge here as part of the statewide trophy musky program. These fish get big.

**Where to fish:** The tailwater below the dam produced the state record. Rocky shoreline, current breaks, deep pools. In the lake, target deep points, channel edges, rocky shoreline, and standing timber edges where forage concentrates.

**Prime season:** Fall (September-November). Muskie feed heavily before winter on larger baitfish. Water temps below 50F push them to deeper vertical structure.

**Tackle requirements:** Heavy-duty - 7'6" to 8'6" extra-heavy rods, 80-100 lb braid, steel leader (12-18 inches, 60-100 lb). Large net (36+ inch hoop). The 2022 state record was caught on a 6-inch glide bait.

**Kim's tip:** Catch-and-release is strongly encouraged. These fish take years to reach trophy size. Handle them in the water when possible, support horizontally for photos, revive thoroughly before release. One muskie in a lifetime is special - let her make more.

### Walleye and Saugeye

Burnsville Lake has a **15-inch minimum size limit** for walleye - stricter than statewide regulations. This protects younger fish and builds trophy potential.

**Where to fish:** Rocky points and channel edges during day. Shallow flats (6-12 ft) at night. The walleye here follow classic reservoir patterns - deep during heat of day, shallow after dark.

**Best techniques:**
- **Daytime trolling:** Deep-diving crankbaits along channel edges at 1.5-2.0 mph
- **Night trolling:** Shallow-running cranks over 8-12 ft flats at 1.8-2.2 mph
- **Jigging:** 3/8 to 3/4 oz with minnows or paddle-tails around rocky points at dusk

**Kim's tip:** Summer night fishing is when the walleye bite best here. Troll Rapala Floaters or Shallow Shad Raps over the flats after dark. Vary your speed with trolling motor bursts to trigger strikes.

## The Crappie Fishery

This is why the locals come. Forty to sixty crappie in an evening is not uncommon for anglers who know the brush piles.

**Where to fish:** Brush piles and standing timber. Use side-imaging sonar to mark structure in 8-20 feet. Spring pushes them shallow (4-8 ft); summer and fall they suspend 12-20 feet around deeper brush.

**Best techniques:**
- Vertical jigging with 1/16 to 1/8 oz jigs tipped with minnows
- Spider rigging with multiple rods at various depths
- Cast and retrieve small jigs beyond brush pile

**Jig colors:** White, chartreuse, pink in stained water. Natural colors in clear water.

**Kim's tip:** Fish the brush and timber. Spring and fall concentrate them. Use 10-12 foot light-power crappie rods with 4-8 lb mono or braid with fluoro leader. Mark your waypoints - the fish will be there next trip too.

## Bass Fishing

Strong population of largemouth and spotted bass. The lake hosts bass tournaments nearly every weekend during season.

**Where to fish:** Shoreline structure, submerged stumps, standing timber edges. Largemouth relate to wood and shallow cover. Spotted bass prefer deeper structure and rocky points.

**Seasonal patterns:**
- **Spring:** Pre-spawn crankbaits on points. Spawn in protected coves 2-6 ft.
- **Summer:** Early/late topwater. Midday deep-diving cranks along timber edges.
- **Fall:** Lipless crankbaits, Alabama rigs following shad schools.

**Kim's tip:** The water clarity varies here - downsize to natural colors when it is clear, bump up to chartreuse and white when it is stained. Work the stumps slow with plastics and you will find fish.

## Catfish

Channel catfish are consistent. Flathead catfish offer trophy potential - a 58-pounder was documented here.

**Where to fish:** Flats near creek channels (8-20 ft) for channel cats. Deep holes in creek channel (20-30+ ft), logjams, and channel bends for flatheads.

**Best techniques:**
- **Channel cats:** Carolina rig with chicken liver, cut shad, nightcrawlers. Night fishing best in summer.
- **Flatheads:** Large live baits (bluegill where legal, big shiners) on slip-sinker rigs in deeper holes. These fish hunt actively after dark.

**Kim's tip:** Night fishing with cut bait is hard to beat for channel cats. For flatheads, you need patience and big baits. June and July nights are prime.

## Tailwater Trout

**Important:** Burnsville Lake itself is NOT stocked with trout. Trout stocking occurs exclusively in the tailwater (Little Kanawha River below the dam).

**Stocking schedule:** Twice monthly February through April. Check the stocking hotline at (304) 558-3399 or wvdnr.gov for specific dates.

**Access:** Below dam via Riffle Run area. Handicap-accessible walkway available.

**Best techniques:** Spinners (Rooster Tails, Panther Martins), small crankbaits, PowerBait on bottom rigs. Fish fresh stockings or let them settle into cooler pockets.

## Boat Ramps and Access

## Water Levels and Conditions

The Corps of Engineers manages Burnsville Lake for flood control. Water levels fluctuate seasonally:

- **Winter pool:** 776 feet (reduced surface area)
- **Summer pool:** 789 feet (maximum recreation access)

Fall drawdown (starting October) exposes shoreline structure and concentrates fish in the main channel. Spring refill coincides with spawning activity.

## Getting There

From WV Wild Outdoors:

1. Head south on US-19 to Flatwoods (about 10 miles)
2. Get on I-79
3. For Riffle Run / Dam: Take Exit 79, Old Route 5 East, 3 miles
4. For Bulltown / Upper Lake: Take Exit 67, Route 19 North, 13 miles

**Total drive time:** 25 minutes from the shop.

## Kim's Take

"This lake does not get fished near as hard as it should. Most folks drive past on I-79 to get somewhere else and they are missing out.

The muskie fishery is legitimate - state records do not come from average lakes. The 15-inch walleye minimum is building something special. And the crappie fishing has always been good if you fish the brush.

Three boat ramps, all wheelchair accessible. Marina with pontoon rentals if you do not have a boat. 200+ campsites at Bulltown. Tailwater trout in the spring.

The only downside is limited cell coverage. Download your maps, tell someone your plan, and enjoy the fact that nobody can bother you out there.

Stop by the shop and I will tell you where the crappie have been stacking up. We stock jigs, minnows, crankbaits, and everything you need for a day on the water."
