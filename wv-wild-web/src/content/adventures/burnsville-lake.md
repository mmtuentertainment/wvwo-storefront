# Burnsville Lake - State Record Muskie Waters

Burnsville Lake is where West Virginia's state-record muskie came from. 51 pounds, 55.06 inches. Lucas King pulled it from the tailwater in March 2022 on a 6-inch glide bait cast from shore.

But Burnsville was producing long before that record. Crappie anglers have been filling coolers here for decades - 40 to 60 fish evenings around the brush piles. Fish in the morning, explore Civil War history at Bulltown Historical Area in the afternoon, then camp overnight at one of 200+ sites.

## What Makes It Special

- **STATE RECORD MUSKIE** - 51 lbs, 55.06" (Lucas King, March 2022)
- **15-inch walleye minimum** - Burnsville-specific regulation (stricter than statewide)
- **Excellent crappie** - 40-60 fish evenings around brush piles
- **3 boat ramps** - Riffle Run, Bulltown Campground, Bulltown Day Use
- **Marina with pontoon rentals** - Burnsville Docks at Bulltown
- **200+ campsites** - Bulltown and Riffle Run campgrounds
- **Tailwater trout** - Stocked Feb-April below the dam

## Regulations

**CRITICAL: 15-inch minimum walleye** - This is stricter than statewide regulations. All walleye under 15 inches must be released immediately.

**Trout stamp required** for tailwater fishing below the dam. Trout are NOT stocked in the lake proper.

## Kim's Take

"Burnsville is special. That state record muskie came from the tailwater, but there are giants in the main lake too. The crappie fishing is some of the best in central WV - get on the brush piles with a good fish finder and you'll fill a cooler. Just remember that 15-inch walleye minimum. It's stricter here than anywhere else in the state."
