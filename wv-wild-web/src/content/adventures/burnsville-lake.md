# Burnsville Lake WMA

Burnsville Lake Wildlife Management Area covers 12,579 acres of gentle uplands, old farm fields, and young forest along the Little Kanawha River in northern Braxton County. The 968-acre lake is surrounded by huntable land managed cooperatively by WV DNR and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers.

25 minutes from our shop and you are on water or in the woods. The terrain is accessible - gentle ridges, old logging roads, mowed field edges. Good for hunters of any age or ability level.

## What to Hunt

### White-Tailed Deer (September - January)

12,579 acres means room to spread out. Old farm fields grown into early successional forest make prime deer habitat. Bucks bed in the thick young growth during rifle season and move to field edges at dawn and dusk.

**Kim's tip:** Those gentle uplands along the river make for good glassing. Old farm fields bring deer out at dawn and dusk. I like the edges where young forest meets open ground. Bucks bed in the thick stuff during rifle season.

### Wild Turkey (Spring: April, Fall: October)

Spring gobblers love the bottomlands near the Little Kanawha River. They roost in the big timber along the water and fly down to feed in the old fields. Set up before daybreak and listen - they sound off good in that river valley.

**Kim's tip:** Spring gobblers love those bottomlands near the Little Kanawha. Set up near old fields before daybreak. Listen for roosted birds - they sound off good in that river valley. Fall hunting is decent too, but spring is when they really talk.

### Ruffed Grouse (October - February)

Young forest equals grouse. This WMA has it. Walk the logging roads slow and work the thick edges where regeneration is heavy. Grouse flush hard and fast - keep your safety off and your head on a swivel.

**Kim's tip:** Young forest means grouse. Walk the logging roads slow and work those thick edges. They flush hard and fast. Keep your safety off once you hit the brush. Good numbers up here compared to other areas.

### Small Game (Rabbit & Squirrel: September - February)

Rabbits work the field edges and briar patches. Squirrels are in the hardwoods on the ridges. Both are thick. Good for training young dogs, taking kids out, or filling the freezer.

**Kim's tip:** Rabbits work the field edges, squirrels in the hardwoods. Both are thick here. Good for training young dogs or taking kids out. Squirrel hunting the ridge tops in October is as good as it gets.

## What to Fish

Burnsville Lake is 968 acres with 30 miles of shoreline. It does not get the fishing pressure of larger lakes, which means better fishing for those who show up.

### Crappie (Black & White)

Anglers report 40-60 fish in an evening. Fish the brush piles and standing timber. Spring and fall are best.

**Kim's tip:** 30 miles of shoreline and it does not get hammered. Crappie fishing is real good - forty to sixty fish in an evening is not uncommon. Fish the brush and timber.

### Bass (Largemouth, Spotted, Smallmouth)

Strong population, especially largemouth and spotted bass. Work the shoreline structure and submerged stumps.

**Kim's tip:** Bass population is strong, especially largemouth and spotted bass. Work the structure and stumps along the shoreline.

### Catfish (Channel & Flathead)

Night fishing with cut bait or live bait. Channel cats are consistent, flatheads are in there too.

### Trout

Stocked February through May. Fish fresh stockings or let them settle into deeper, cooler water.

**Kim's tip:** They stock trout February through May. Fish the fresh stockings or wait for them to settle into the cooler water.

### Other Species

Walleye, muskie, bluegill, and sauger are all present. Walleye and sauger bite at night. Muskie are rare but big. Bluegill are everywhere.

## Boat Ramps & Facilities

Three boat ramps, all wheelchair-accessible:

1. **Riffle Run Day Use Area**: Concrete ramp, parking, restrooms.
2. **Bulltown Campground**: Ramp with camping access, full facilities.
3. **Bulltown Day Use Area**: Second ramp, parking, picnic area.

All three ramps are maintained by the Corps of Engineers and stay open year-round unless ice is an issue.

### Camping

**Bulltown Campground**: 133 campsites, full RV hookups, showers, dump station, playgrounds. Marina on-site with supplies and services.

### Accessibility

Wheelchair-accessible ramps, paved paths, Class Q hunter accommodations. This WMA is set up for disabled hunters and anglers.

- **Lake Rules**: Corps of Engineers regulations apply on the water and shoreline. No wake zones near ramps and swimming areas.
- **Camping**: Only in designated campground. No dispersed camping on WMA lands.

## Best Times to Visit

- **Spring (April-May)**: Turkey season, trout stocking, bass spawning, crappie active. Best all-around time.
- **Fall (October-November)**: Deer rut, grouse season, squirrel season, fall fishing. Second-best window.
- **Winter (December-January)**: Late deer season, small game, less pressure. Cold but productive.
- **Summer (June-August)**: Fishing only. Bass, catfish, bluegill. Good for camping trips with kids.

## Getting There

From WV Wild Outdoors in Weston:

1. Take US-19 South to Flatwoods (about 10 miles).
2. Get on I-79 North for 2 miles.
3. Take Exit 67 for Burnsville/Glenville.
4. Turn left onto WV-5 West.
5. Follow WV-5 for about 10 miles to Burnsville Lake.
6. Multiple WMA access points are marked off WV-5 and around the lake perimeter.

**Total Drive Time**: 25 minutes from the shop.

Riffle Run and Bulltown areas are well-signed. If you get turned around, stop at the marina or campground office - they will point you right.

## Kim's Take

"This WMA is managed by WV DNR and the Army Corps of Engineers together. It wraps around Burnsville Lake - 968 acres of water that does not get fished near as hard as it should.

The lake is stocked with trout February through May. Bass, crappie, catfish, even muskie and walleye. Three boat ramps and all three are wheelchair accessible. Bulltown Campground has 133 sites with full hookups if you want to make a weekend of it.

Hunting is good for deer, turkey, grouse, rabbit, raccoon. The terrain is gentle uplands and old farm fields grown into young forest. That is prime habitat. Deer bed in the thick stuff and feed in the fields. Turkeys roost along the Little Kanawha and work the bottomlands.

Grouse numbers are better here than a lot of places. Walk those logging roads slow and work the edges. Rabbits and squirrels are thick - good for kids or dogs.

The whole area is set up for disabled hunters and anglers. Class Q accommodations, wheelchair ramps, paved access. That is something you do not see everywhere.

Little Kanawha River runs right through it. You have got 30 miles of shoreline on the lake. That is a lot of water and a lot of woods. You can hunt hard here and not see another soul."

## Why Hunt & Fish Burnsville Lake WMA

25 minutes from our door to 12,579 acres of public land and a 968-acre lake. That is close enough to hunt before work or fish after. The terrain is gentle, the access is good, and the facilities are there.

Deer hunting is solid. Turkey hunting is good in spring. Grouse are present. Small game is thick. The lake fishes better than it should because most folks drive past it to get somewhere else.

This is not wilderness. It is managed land with mowed fields, gravel roads, and marked trails. But it is public, it is close, and it works.

Come by the shop. We will get you set up with whatever you need - licenses, maps, ammo, tackle. Then go see it yourself.
