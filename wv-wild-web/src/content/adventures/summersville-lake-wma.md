# Summersville Lake WMA - 5,982 Acres of Hunting Around West Virginia's Largest Lake

Summersville Lake Wildlife Management Area wraps nearly 6,000 acres of public hunting land around West Virginia's largest lake. The terrain ranges from forested rolling hills to dramatic vertical rock cliffs overlooking crystal-clear water. Oak-hickory forests dominate, providing excellent habitat for deer, turkey, grouse, and small game.

30 minutes from our shop and you're on public land surrounding the "Little Bahamas of the East."

## CRITICAL: No Bear Hunting 2025

**Nicholas County has been REMOVED from the 2025 bear hunting season.** No bear hunting is permitted on Summersville Lake WMA in 2025. If you're after bear, head to Braxton or Webster County instead.

## What to Hunt

### White-Tailed Deer

Nicholas County is OPEN for antlerless deer harvest with both base license and Class N/NN stamps. Good population in the oak-hickory forests.

**Where to hunt:** Ridge tops and transition zones between forest and lake clearings. The Archery Trail area (reopened July 2024) is excellent for early season.

**When to hunt:** Peak rut mid-November. Archery opens Sept 27, Buck firearms Nov 24-Dec 7, Muzzleloader Dec 15-21.

### Wild Turkey

Mixed hardwood ridges hold excellent turkey populations. Spring gobblers respond well to calls in the mature timber.

**Where to hunt:** Battle Run and Salmon Run areas have good roosting habitat near the lake.

**Calling strategy:** Set up on same contour elevation. Call aggressively in oak-hickory timber.

### Waterfowl

Summersville Lake and surrounding wetlands offer waterfowl opportunities other WMAs can't match. Boat access essential for scouting coves and creek mouths.

**Requirements:** Federal duck stamp required in addition to WV license and HIP registration. Steel shot only.

### Ruffed Grouse & Small Game

Grouse in regenerating timber and edge habitat. Squirrel in oak-hickory forests with good mast. Rabbit in transition zones.

## Access Points

### Battle Run Area (Primary)
From US-19 south of Summersville, take Battle Run Road. Primary access with large parking, boat ramp, and nearby campground. Best for waterfowl staging.

### Salmon Run Area
More rugged terrain with less hunting pressure. Steep access requires good physical condition.

### Archery Trail Area (Reopened July 2024)
Walk-in only for archery hunting. Excellent early season deer. Limited parking.

- **Blaze orange** 400+ square inches during firearms deer season
- **No Sunday hunting** (state law)
