# Sutton Lake - Central WV's Fishing & Camping Hub

Sutton Lake sits at the heart of central West Virginia - 1,440 acres of Army Corps of Engineers water with walleye, bass, crappie, and catfish. Three campgrounds offer 245 total sites ranging from full hookups to primitive tent camping.

## What Makes It Special

- **Walleye fishery** with 20-30" slot limit (must release immediately)
- **3 USACE campgrounds** - 245 total sites
- **Tailwater trout fishing** below Sutton Dam (stocked by WVDNR)
- **Trophy muskie** in the Elk River tailwaters
- **40 miles of shoreline** for bank fishing and exploration

## Fishing

### Walleye & Saugeye

Sutton Lake is managed for quality walleye. The 20-30 inch slot limit means all fish in that range must be released immediately - this builds trophy potential.

**Best tactics:** Jigs with live minnow trailers, blade baits in winter, trolling crankbaits along main lake points.

### Bass

Largemouth, smallmouth, and spotted bass all present. Work the coves for largemouth, rocky points for smallmouth.

### Tailwater Fishing

Below Sutton Dam, the Elk River tailwaters offer:
- **Stocked trout** (WVDNR stocks regularly)
- **Trophy muskie** - some of the biggest in central WV
- **Smallmouth bass** - excellent numbers

Stop by the shop for fishing licenses, live bait, and current lake conditions.

## Kim's Take

"Sutton Lake is our go-to for walleye in central WV. That slot limit is building some nice fish. But don't sleep on the tailwaters below the dam - the muskie down there can be monsters. Bring heavy tackle if you're fishing below the dam, and pack jigs with live minnows for the lake walleye."
