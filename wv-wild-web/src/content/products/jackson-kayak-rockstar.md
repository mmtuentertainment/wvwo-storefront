The Jackson Kayak Rockstar is built for serious whitewater. We've seen this boat handle everything the Gauley River throws at it - from technical Class IV runs to the big water of Pillow Rock.

## Why This Kayak

We don't stock kayaks that can't handle West Virginia rivers. The Rockstar earned its place in our shop after watching local paddlers push it through Upper Gauley during release season. It's forgiving enough for intermediate paddlers stepping up their game, but responsive enough for experts running the Meadow.

**What makes it work here:**
- Volume distribution handles pushy water (you'll thank us at Sweet's Falls)
- Rocker profile carves clean lines in technical slots
- Outfitting won't fail you mid-run (we've seen cheaper boats come apart)

## Pickup Only

Kayaks don't ship well. Period. We've seen too many boats arrive cracked, and the freight cost alone would add $200-300 to your price. Come pick it up - we'll walk you through outfitting adjustments and point you to the best put-ins within an hour of the shop.
