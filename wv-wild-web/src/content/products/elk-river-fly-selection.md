## Local Knowledge Included

These aren't random patterns from a catalog. We fish the Elk every chance we get, and we've watched what works change with the seasons. The hopper patterns fish well from July through September when you're working the grassy banks near Frame. The nymphs produce year-round, especially in the pocket water between Bergoo and Webster Springs.

**Ships anywhere** or pick up at the shop. If you're local and want to talk about where to fish these, stop by - we'll mark up a map for you.

Grand love ya!
