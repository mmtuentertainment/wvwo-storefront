            We started back in 2008 in the New River Gorge area. Just a sporting goods store for "all sports." 
            We worked hard, but that location... well, we couldn't make it there. 
            Sometimes the Lord closes a door so you have to move.

          <p class="text-brand-cream/80 text-lg leading-relaxed">
            When the waters rose in 2016, our region was devastated. Roads were cut. Neighbors were isolated.
            <br/><br/>
            We didn't post about it online. We didn't look for praise.
            We just did what folks in Braxton County do: we checked on our neighbors, we prayed, and we dug out the mud.
            <br/><br/>
            The store took a hit—over <strong>$70,000</strong> in inventory gone. FEMA denied us. Then a theft.
            But we kept the doors open because this community isn't just a market to us. It's home.
