## Tracking Success

## Technical Notes

Your website schema (the code we added) tells Google:
- Your exact location (coordinates)
- Your business type (Gun Shop + Sporting Goods)
- Your services (FFL transfers, licenses)
- Your service area (50-mile radius from Birch River)
- I-79 corridor positioning

This works WITH your GBP to maximize local search visibility.
