## Quick Reference

**Kim's Messenger:** Uses Bryan's Facebook account

**Best times to message:** She's responsive most times, but avoid Sunday mornings (church)

**Conversation closers to watch for:**
- 👍 emoji = done, don't reply
- "Gotta get to work!" = done, let her go
- "Love ya grand!" at the end = wrapping up

**Re-openers that work:**
- Family questions (kids, grandkids)
- Dad (Mike) updates
- Following up on something she mentioned
- Weather/seasonal check-ins
